Or we can use both.
Secondly, we can use materials.
So we can build .
If we could roll ?
20 percent are getting treated.
I like to just end.

Hasan , just curious .
Typically , years old .
Next , dynamic interface .
Okay , next question .
And these are the data.
So these are the components.
So, these are the problems.
And these were somewhat noticed.
My life was not exuberant.
I take it to therapy.
What is going on here?
What is our intellect ?
What is our approach ?

Are we providing the software?
Are we there yet ?
How we get spectra ?
Are we safer today ?
Are we alone ? &quot;
June what ? Sixth .
I extracted DNA from them.
Whatever that means to you.
And that connection is change.
And that creates additional costs.
So that doesn't really work.
And that doesn't seem right.
But that sounds really techie.
And that goat was $120.
Well, that just ended communication.
Now, that wasn't just self-indulgence.

They've had bailouts in Europe.
Abed had said something remarkable.

This one is an antibiotic.
This one is very low-power.
No one is getting money.
No one is exactly shocked.
This one is in England.
Which one is it ?
This one involves men .
Will we win that way?
Should we talk to Hamas?
And we architects are cowards.
And we went down, investigated.
Because we can't solve problems.
But we don't really know.
Well, we needn't have worried.
Did we mix or not?
There we go. All right.
And we said, "He's five."
And we met with him.
And we said, "That's incredible!"
But we aren't even starting.
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
Can we run that, Andrew?
So we got to work.
And we launched our platform.
Can we play that one?
So we rented this space.
So we didn't do it.
Could we leverage the cloud?
But we can't do everything.
Will we play a tune?
Can we roll the video?
And we got to Broadmoor.
So we resynthesized this song.
If we could, would we?
And we finished our trip.
Can we hold it together?
So, we went down actually.
So we built big models.
So we collect this MR.
So we cut into them.
So, we get climate change.
Can we get self-replicating-type behavior?
And we split these bridges.
So we went into it.
That, we get for free.
But, we don't have time.
But we pay for school.
So we built it again.
Now we move the payoffs.
So we collect this MR.
And we never did .
So we noticed change .
And we request them .
So we got it .
So we walked around .
So we get this .
And we practice holism .
Because we lived scattered .
So we collect this MR.
And we get confirmation .
Sometimes we spread out .
And we &apos;re vulnerable .
So we got started .
Do we stop there ?
Sometimes we just forget .
And we don &apos;t .
So we &apos;re thrilled .
And we &apos;re miserable .
So we built something .
Could we reinvent fire ?
And we &apos;re here .
But we failed him .
And we &apos;re alive .
And after that, we succeeded.
Oh, after you stopped paying.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
Because our time is up.

Why should we care ?
We'll use biofuels. Problem solved.
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
They use his rhetoric .
Always use remote control .
Others use psychedelic drugs .
You use sign language .
How can we address them?"
How can we know this?
How can we do it?
It can even change you.
How can we help you?
How can we do that?
We can save that one.
We can inspire each other.
We can calculate the aspect.
We can get productivity up.
We can get efficiency up.
We can design better games.
We can heal the disease.
We can harness those benefits.
We can capture that information.
We can go much further.
We can fly around them.
We can choose otherwise .

A massive cardiac arrest .
We found this last year.
We found marsupial lions .
We found carnivorous kangaroos .
Maybe no one's really crazy.
That's no sacrifice, that's revenge!
There's no feeling about germs.
So no wilderness, no revelations.
There's no real emergence there.
There's no breeding pairs left.
There's no rocket science here.
There's no competition at all.
There's no comparison at all.
There's no ice over it.
Basically, no one's very happy.
Because no one's really watching.
So no ego problems .
And no hiking boots .
So no human interaction .
So, cells have this cycle.
The cells looked better .
The small stuff counts .
What will they do tomorrow?
And they started settling out.
And they actually do .
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.
See any common themes? Principles?
But how to reach it?
So, how to build this.
Find these resources. Apply them.
Notice these other, smaller protuberances.
And these allegations are false.
And these fossils still breathe.
And these await our discovery.
No, these legs are great.
But these things are everywhere.
Fundamentally, these technologies exist today.
And these frightened her .
And these beautiful umbrellas .
It only spoils the darkness.
It only has five contributors.
Audience member 4 : Q.
The right to live, period.
I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.
I said "play," all right.
Chapter two starts in 1991.
What could I do ?
They targeted to universities .
The new me is beauty.
Our antibiotics are running out.
The second time, it's engineering.
The second "A" is Awareness.

Her cancer continued to grow.
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.
Does it have a toxicity?
And it represents your influence.
Give it up for that.
And it still didn't work?
And it certainly was .
Getting it over there ?
Do it over lunch .
So it needs refurbishment .
Warm up your voice .
We live in one world.
We live in ignorance .
Look here at Kenya .
The numbers are pretty crazy.
What should it be for?
What should they do ?
What can damage accumulate in?
What can they do ?
You can make multiple subjects.
Look what we &apos;ve ...
Look what we &apos;ve ...
Now I am making films.
Everybody: I am my connectome.
Boy: I would love to.
Hi. I am an architect.
And I am illustrating Still.

I want an iPhone .
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.
The older face is miserable.
The food is incredible .
So those are the consequences.
And those bits are words.
Because those are voluntary distractions.
So those three actors .
So those are great .
And those distributions grow .
We see all this complexity.
We see above-ground mines .
How would we know it?
Who would go for bananas?
People would name the robots.
It would skip a beat.
How would you do it?
How would we finance this?
How would you feel ?
Who would do that ?
circuit boards of the future.
And so we started thinking.
Or so we should hope.
And so we should .
My time &apos;s up .
clinical inquisitiveness was democratized .
Here, but -- -- anyway.
We started in 2004 .
We set up a foundation.
Now, follow my actions exactly.
That's been medicalized as well.
It's been created; nobody knows.
They've been around for decades.
She's been suffering for years.
Point well made. Thank you.
One cannot assume this .
We applied the genetic algorithm.
And here is that characteristic.
You need a pressure suit.
You need a safe space.
You need a melt probe.
You need a guide .
We take a microscope slide.
his abdomen was nontender .
I pulled them aside .
They first dropped some dummies.
And first it's quite simple.
Well, first one, analytic skills.
Look very closely at pilgrimage.
It might give them pause.
It might change my behavior.
We might learn something unexpected.
Poor people are a resource.
Think about what happened .
What about Martin Luther King?
What about copying, reusing, right?
What about time and gas?
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
What about global politics ?
What about animal testing ?
What about real people ?
What about bigger numbers ?
What about energy conservation ?
What about introducing technology ?
So some people say no.
In some it is hot.
He used shell companies .
Why did she say that?
Why did I say that?
When did that last happen?
Why did she say that?
Why did America get serious?
Why did I do it?
Why did you do that?
So did my typeface .
How long are you staying?"
A page was created .
Also, high stress inhibits oxytocin.
It will always be remembered.
We will observe this day.
We will go all in.
The will is there .
And will it happen ?
Okay, one more. Baby elephant.
That's one thing to remember.
This one I particularly like.
But one thing is clear.
But one day, something happened.
That's one billion media hits.
But one really struck me.
But one more added feature.
No one works on that.
No one wants it .
This one I love .
No one &apos;s fooled .
No one believed them .
No one &apos;s laughing .
Which one seems longer ?
And they all fit together.
So they all cluster together.
There, they enter high officialdom.
No, they turn across here.
Had they consumed colored drinks?
So, they answered my emails.
And they both laughed .
So they all trained .
Do they make sense ?
Then they grow exponentially .
And they never will .
How they maintain them ?
Are they so different ?
Are they cattle ? &quot;
Are they saving enough ?
What do we do now?
What do you guys think?
What do you get then?
What do you think, honey?"
What do you see here?
What do they tell us?
What do you mean, epidemic?
What do we typically finance?
What do they look like?
What do you look for?
What do we find now?
What do they do ?
What do you see ?
What do you want ?
What do you do ?
What do you think ?
What do you do ?
What do you do ?
What do they do ?
What do they do ?
What do you say ?
What do you do ?
What do you do ?
What do you got ?
And women do fundraising .
Day five and day six.
That's our job as cosmologists.
That's our next big challenge.
That's our number. 10 billion.
Well, now is that time.
And their actions are fantastic.
We needed more time .
We live on a planet.
You influenced the market .
Compassion also looks like this.
It's also good with credit.
It's also tastes and smells.
It's also memory of sequences.
They're also harmless plankton-feeding animals.
He also appealed to hope.
Contestants also put themselves forward.
It's also about creating government.
You're also talking about baseball.
They also live deep .
They also got faster .
She also embraced violence .

Together, may we journey well.
You may think that's impossible.
You may recognize her .

You could even hear it.
You could inform school policy.
You could inform legislation .
How could they see this?
Who could sleep that night?
How could it be otherwise?
It could get awkward, right?
How could it become iconic?
How could we survive that?
Who could blame them ?
How could that be ?
How could this be ?
How could that work ?
And so it goes on.
And so it goes .
One exception is in Massachusetts.
Now here are the facts.
And here are the statistics.
And here are the results.
So here are 12 dinosaurs.
A Mexican composer: Arturo Marquez.
What does it look like?
What does it look like?
What does it mean ?
What does it do ?
What does it mean ?
What does it mean ?
Anybody see an object there?
And I was so stimulated.
And I was so thrilled.
And I was very lucky.
Now I was pretty psyched.
BP: I was born old.
And I was like, "Sure."
And I was like, "Okay."
And I was permanently hooked.
And I was like, "Why?"
And I was just moved.
Because I was a writer.
And I was thrilled .
But I was lucky .
So I was amazed .
So I was scared .
And I was mad .
And I was fascinated .
And I was devastated .
So I was filming .
But I was intrigued .
And I was outraged .
And I was honored .
I go by the data."
I learned this from Spider-Man.
I learned something about courage.
I noticed it's very multicultural.
I go to Chrysokeras .
I go to JPL .
I learned about compassion .
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
We need — thank you.
We need culture out there."
We need new deep-diving submarines.
We need active system .
We need three things .
We need caring economics .
We need better surveillance .
We need independent corroboration .
We need someone for .
We need better tools .
We need lots more .
We need better accounting .
We need real people .
And there we are, 2001.
So there he is there.
Could there be a connection?
And there she goes, right.
Everyone there understood the project.
So there they are .
So there you are .
And there &apos;s dehydration .
And there &apos;s hypothermia .
So there you are .
And there RISD appeared .
So there it is .
And there we were .
And there he was .
And there he is .
And there &apos;s Evan .
And there you are .
And there it goes .
It should imagine a user.
How should you start ?
Business should give more .
That's probably not very many.
You can feel your body.
They can actually have both.
Amateurs can do it also.
You can do bigger things.
Secrets can take many forms.
Secrets can take many forms.
So, can we see that?
You can give drug administration.
You can do heckler mode.
Surfaces can become porous .
Deception can cost billions .
You can understand it .
You can do this .
Models can come from industry.
It can hover and rotate.
It can follow chemical gradients.
It can break sometimes .
How can metronomes communicate ?
It can prompt action .
How can you tell ?
How can this be ?
The last thing is gregariousness.
The last "A" is Authenticity.
The last thing is emotion.
The last element is partnership.
But both started exploring it.
You both feel you've won.
They both hide out .
Pune has 5,000 building sites.
Monkey has like you have.
Why has it accelerated lately?
Everyone has done something .
Why has that happened ?
Nobody has questioned it .
He has 280,000 followers .
This has huge implications .
Why has violence decreased ?
Where has it been ?
Nobody has pagers anymore .
Small people wandering about .
Constructed each plank of gold.
The others were brothers, sisters.
It began the space race.
All done in the lab.
And then it was abandoned.
And then it became news.
And then it becomes more.
And then it got stranger.
What might they find ?
We now wield the paintbrush."
Number four -- deconstruct appliances.
The same applies to educators.
The same thing happens .
Huge effect here of Starbucks.
It seemed to be infinite.
What will that lead to?
We set out on crutches.
Because, well we know why.
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.
Ninety-nine percent of you .
OK, any six of them.
Take any African economy .
But most importantly, it's voluntary.
So most everyone watches TV.
And most importantly, it's working.
And most kids do .
We even double checked .
They control your phone .
Very good for the physicians.
Days before he died .
People seem to love it.
Brains only detect nerve impulses.
If only Darwin lived today.
If only Darwin had NASA.
Another 30 percent will respond.
One example is sanitation .
But I could not understand.
I happen to have triplets.
I succeeded in my place.
I felt pretty good, considering.
I told them they're nuts.
I felt just something's broken.
I felt so sick .
Meat consumption increased five-fold .
The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.
The third area is reproduction.
The third side is us.
These people have different needs.
These people are deceived, forced.
These people are art collectors.
These people are tall .
More about that later, OK.
How about counting every calorie?
How about augmenting the physician?
How about Zander's Crevice? No.
How about artistic beauty ?
How about Facebook itself ?
How about seven hours ?
How about bed nets ?
Intent changes the picture completely.
That changes the picture considerably.
So new life was born.
Not so in Italy .
At some point something clicked.
The person buys property .
N On Twitter also .
Adults find it comforting .
Just type over it .
That's where the difference is.
You become the authority .
So it wasn't about symmetry.
And it sent me back.
But it wasn't just individuals.
Well it doesn't break even.
And it hurts your throat.
But it takes some persistence.
But it actually hits home.
But it looks completely right.
But it built a romance.
First, it represented his identity.
But it wouldn't stop there.
But it brings me back.
But it clearly cools down.
And it works. It works.
But it slightly bores me.
And it isn't always fair.
Shut it down at once."
But it doesn't stop there.
So it doesn't matter whatsoever.
Make it faster and smaller.
But it actually doesn't leak.
And it didn't stop there.
Put it on four plates.
And it made me suspicious.
Otherwise, it can't be done.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
But it paid the bills.
Hopefully it matches his taste.
But it didn't stop there.
And it -- they burned.
But it starts a conversation.
And it won't be done.
So it really is great.
Furthermore it says, "Start time."
So it can't be true."
And it can't be done.
And it actually means sad.
And it actually worked great.
Gets it right, reward him.
And it works like this.
But it wasn't that simple.
Then it came way down.
And it goes over here?
Ultimately, it gives you this.
But it works pretty well.
And it goes like this.
Did it answer the question?
So it started over here.
And it looks really good.
And it builds up exponentially.
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
But it isn &apos;t .
And it &apos;s simple .
And it looks delicious .
Then it changes again .
Give it another try .
And it &apos;s working .
But it diminishes considerably .
Did it strike you ?
But it doesn &apos;t .
Then it &apos;s gone .
Now it &apos;s gone .
Will it happen again ?
And it &apos;s interesting .
And it &apos;s everywhere .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
But it &apos;s ugly .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
Because it sounds big .
So it spawns itself .
So it &apos;s cool .
Actually it gets weirder .
Essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
But it &apos;s not .
But it goes further .
Now it encourages it .
And it &apos;s political .
Take it away Eric .
Appreciate it very much .
But it &apos;s damaging .
Well it &apos;s extraordinary .
And it &apos;s expanding .
Then it deserves protection .
Now it &apos;s green .
And it gets quiet .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Because it &apos;s true .
Will it do it ?
But it &apos;s deteriorating .
Will it be taken ?
Clearly it &apos;s freezing .
And it &apos;s fantastic .
Enjoying it so far ?
And it happened twice .
Bring it back up .
Again it &apos;s playing .
But it got attention .
Obviously it &apos;s increasing .
So it &apos;s 2006 .
Maybe it &apos;s spiders .
But it gets better .
But it &apos;s uninspiring .
How do we change behavior?
How do you test this?
How do we control them?
How do you do that?
How do we solve it?
How do you parameterize "mostly"?
How do we reconfigure it?
How do you skim stones?
How do we know this?
How do you do it?
How do you do this?
How do they do it?
How do we go faster?
How do you monetize that?
How do you get insight?
How do we explain this?
How do you cast mud?
How do we study that?
How do you get informed?
How do we know that?
How do you answer them?
How do you condense that?
How do you show that?
How do you do it?
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
How do we do that?
How do we get out?
How do you know that?
How do we do that?
How do you do that?
How do you know ?
How do you know ?
How do you know ?
How do you know ?
How do we create ?
How do you start ?
Who do you trust ?
Who do we got ?
We do more than that.
We do social change .
We do it again .
The brain works by association.
The pain gets less .
We start the meeting .
He maintained a calm insouciance.
Our standard see-through patient .
We then put in framing.
Is then sustainable development utopia?
Both countries are in Asia.
Here's how the song goes.
Here's how the dots connected.
Or if geologists were elephants?
The bone is cracked .
The exception was Japan .
We're based down in Florida.
Last question , Julian .
We believe it is .
The usual sort of thing.
Zhuomani instead of Armani .
Mental note on that one.
They make it sacred .
All preparation is preparation .
What does this all mean?
What does this compassion entail?
What does this cause us?
What does this mean ?
What does this mean ?
What does this mean ?
What does this mean ?
How does it do it?
How does it work ?
How does it work ?
People see each other behaving.
It's now a theme park.
So, now a false count.
Why would you do that?
"Why would I do that?
So would I do nothing?
Abed would say, "I'm sorry."
Why would you choose rats?

I got plenty of takers.
So I wrote a letter.
I don't have a clue.
And I thought, go figure.
I mean, it's quite brutal.
So I scraped it off.
Then I got a scoop.

Maybe I'll feel good myself.
And, yeah, I'm proud, too.
But it's still fairly quiet.
Wires suck, they really do.

So micropayments have become huge.
It's incredibly important right now.
I'm intrigued by this concept.
Kirby Ferguson: Embrace the remix
My dad came out again.
Now I'm a science reporter.
And I'm also a mother.
It's fun to be fooled.

And yet, it never happens.
But there's a fourth thing.

So they're not a donation.
Stephen Hawking: Questioning the universe
Now, Frank didn't hear anything.
Now, that's not true anymore.
And it's wonderful, wonderful work.
Obviously experimentation is very important.
And there's this huge hubbub.
Archie lets it die down.
And it's 10 triliion dollars.
It's wireless. It's always connected.
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.
So here's what you do.
So what's going on here?
There is. Head-tail-head overlaps itself.
You're done, and you celebrate.
And secondly, it's palpably false.
Now, that's a logical error.
CL: And so she's phenomenal.
And yes, there is hope.
Text: Beethoven doesn't excite her.
So you've got to focus.
You've got to keep going.

My children, Davey and Henry.
But yet, it was human.
So immediately, we're rejecting them.
TM: 12, something like that.
This time, he comes down.
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility."
And that's a simple question.
It's like, what is simplicity?
Anything else is more complicated.
You know, no power required.
Ze Frank: So -- yeah.
That song -- Thank you.
Ze Frank: My web playroom
Those magnets are in there.
Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement.
Higgs particles, if you will.
"But why?" I asked him.
So it's time for change.
"Come on, man! What policemen?
This gin, this salty earth."
Yes. But we need mechanization.
Eat it, and feel privileged.
But, again, heavy fishing pressures.
Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.
And it's not a diet.
It's important, but not enough.
Dean Ornish: Healing through diet
They don't. They store fat.
RW: That's terrific. Thank you.
Keith Bellows: The camel's hump
Bugs Bunny is my muse.
That doesn't make any sense.

And that's what she does.
Now we've got a movement.
Well yeah, I tried that.
But we're not there yet.
First, there's no Rosetta Stone.
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.
They didn't help at all.
Nobody sang the old ones.
So it's very promising, actually.
Curtis Wong: Thank you, Roy.
Arousal addiction, you want different.
It's pressure-sensitive, you can notice.
Hold on! Wait a minute!
Of course, criminals can respond.
Now, let's actually learn something.

Time, nobody can see time.
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.

They're happy. They are satisfied.
Alessandro Acquisti: Why privacy matters
Now I'm a middle-aged guy.
She earns around 12,000 rupees.
My biggest challenge is society.
Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
I'm incredibly excited about that.
And "you can trust us."
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.
Okay. So, thank you, Mark.
So let's talk about effectiveness.
How? And at what scale?
Now, that's the good news.
So I'm sitting there thinking.
AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.
DP: Let Derek play it.
That is, share your lunch.
Or fire. Or dry soils.
And it's a copyright violation.
"Dig wells for five years?
Battered, bruised, you start again.
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.

She is, after all, Cuban.
She says this to me.
"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
And that's the sad part.
Again, deliberate action is needed.
Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.
But there's an interesting paradigm.
But that's not the case.
That clause was obviously ignored.
Maybe there's a biological answer.
Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income.
That's complex, but it's manageable.
Sendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.
Stefan Sagmeister: Designing with slogans
Forward, don't move the wrist.
Lennart Green: Three -- good.
Ten, jack, queen, king, ace.

Same mistake as before, right?
Another suit. LG: Diamonds, perfect.
Oh sorry, I dropped one.
Looks good, like Batman. Ow!
Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts.
Maybe I'll stand up. Half.
Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.
No? Yes! Ah, good, good.
And queen! Queen, with misdirection.
He sounds something like this.
But that's not happening here.
So that's pretty much it.
They say, "Really? How many?"
Well, charity became their answer.
Okay? Ready? Let's do it.
So that's a good thing.
So Kleiber is about process.
But we're spending 36 percent.
Well what's going to give?
No crows are brought up.
Ivan Oransky: Are we over-medicalized?
And it's a charming read.
Chris Bliss: Comedy is translation

He said, "You boneless bookworm!
You know, it's just ludicrous.
"For sale: White trash compactor."
He hung up on me!
And didn't that feel good?
Yikes! So many big threats!
Fiber: next-generation way of communicating.
So again, radical versus conservative.
Don't move. Stand your ground.
They laughed. They dismissed us.
Nirmalya Kumar: India's invisible innovation
Ten percent's come from India.
And they're investing in energy.
Now, that's completely changed now.

Economists aren't great at forecasting.
My iPod's full of them.
Charles Robertson: Africa's next boom
Now it's all available online.
And he's five years old.
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
There ain't no first time.
She can't understand the dialogue.
We've got all of that.
And it's true. It's true.
Come on: those masterpieces ...
OK? Stop. All right, now.
So, ah, that was fun.
Hopefully everybody? More than 10?
No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.
It's classically learning by doing.
So there's more. There's more.
Well, it's the relative importance.
And there's some spectacular things.
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.
So they're simple building blocks.
Phil Hansen: Embrace the shake
It's incredibly difficult to parse.
So that's the bottom line.
But we're not so comfortable.
But it's time to talk.
Sherry Turkle: Connected, but alone?
MO: So we started organizing.
Together: Someone get me Post-its!
And there's two of me.
CO: And we needed help.
MO: It's not rocket science.

So you've got that covered.
Kevin Kelly: Technology's epic story
She got a support network.
Another "Associate Director of Research."
This amazing person, Muriel Cooper.
So here's what we're doing.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
We've got to change that.
Naturally 7: A full-band beatbox
You've misunderstood totally," he said.
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.
And Cyrus makes a declaration.
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.
Ultimately, that's what it's about."
He said, "It's absolutely possible."
Terrible Najmuddin, is that one.
Their decisions, their actions matter.
Thank you, and God bless.
And I'll tell you why.
Hmm. You've heard of it.
Why don't they affect me?
And everything began pretty auspiciously.
Everything else is the same.
So it's a straightforward machine.
Now, let's imagine a parallel.
Now, don't get me wrong.
And again, everyone ate local.
I've talked for three minutes.
So that's a large number.
JH: Whoa. That is ...
TS: So something like this.
JH: So many forces there.
But it's actually a painting.
So that's what she did.
But it's become something else.
Origami revolves around crease patterns.
And yeah, you really can.
HR: So there you go.
SR: "Did that just work?"
Thank you. XL: Thank you.
Pico Iyer: Where is home?
Now, we're still collecting data.
So, salamanders can do it.
Anthony Atala: Growing new organs
And you'd make these chairs.
Shit, you've missed 25 years.
My kids love this stuff.
That's it. Please save this.
So here's exhibit number one.
This guy is no Republican.
Lawrence Lessig: Re-examining the remix
And they're just so uncomfortable.
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!
Onyx Ashanti: This is beatjazz
Of course, they were confused.
Or, "How can we help?"
And then, the systemic risks.
My father's a little different.
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat] SW: Yeah.
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
SW: Do your head now.
E: Happy birthday to you.
E: Happy birthday to you.
E: Happy birthday to you.
E: Happy birthday to you.
Jonathan Eisen: Meet your microbes
So how's all this governed?
That's neo-Nazi math for you.
Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.
And it's a made-up word.
They didn't know how to.
Some rocks and some finches.
Joshua Silver: Adjustable liquid-filled eyeglasses
Oh, you're wiggling your toes.
You glaze over with it.
Which means, "Take my camera."
And they're also curiously aggressive.
Thank you. Thanks very much.
Hi, sir, how are you?
Now, let's try that again.
No, they're not the same.
They say, "Let's question authority."
And again, think about it.
So glamour can be dangerous.
Eve Ensler: Suddenly, my body
This pirate is called Joshua.
Fantastic. Just stay up here.
Capital, Malé, where I live.
Then Malé, then further south.
They're up, and they're off.
They hatched out in India.
And that's where it breeds.
It's, well, you can imagine.
And they're not all bad.
RM: You'll get a text.
Thank you. John. That's great.
So that's another demographic fact.
JH: Last question. Right here.
So now, how is that?
Benevolence, loving kindness against hatred.
And jumping monks of Tibet.
And yet, look around us.
But that's not completely true.
And occasionally, there are disasters.
This song is called "Fingertips."
So that's what I do.
My bitches wear my collars.

Bess: As you wish, Majesty.
And it's like a magnet.
Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Thumper: Some fun, huh, Bambi?
Ha ha. No, no, no.
This locomotion was completely involuntary.
And it's full of challenges.
It's "Aria" of John Cage.
Right. So what has changed?
And Wikipedia has embraced this.
They'll fund anything these days.
But again, it's very paternalistic.
Washington, D.C. went out here.
But ignore the top part.
So they're moving further apart.
TM: Thank you very much.
TM: Thank you very much.
So, it's a normal-looking syringe.
And they're focusing on function.
And it's in every cell.
Janine Benyus: Biomimicry in action
So see, here's the thing.
So funny things can happen.
So he's just explaining something.
Now here's an interesting comparison.
And yes, we Africans can.
Remember, that's a short time.
Kary Mullis: Play! Experiment! Discover!
Miru Kim: My underground art
So here's some inorganic life.
Of course, they're not alive.
Now, that's a bit boring.
And forgive the complicated diagram.
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.
They're inanimate, they're not alive.
Until midnight, he'd be thinking.
"No ... not at all."
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars.
LP: Thank you very much.
Their burn-up is much higher.
So, it's a fake real.
Joseph Pine: What consumers want
And that's the whole piece.
So, that's a finished gear.
And I'm not that far.
You've heard about solar flares.
She said, "What's going on?"
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.
Gary Wolf: The quantified self
You know, a data network.
This lets you do it.
You don't have enough time.
So bees have social healthcare.
So remember, I said 4D.
No, they're all out there.
They're glorified drill and practice.
Radio 2: That was gorgeous.
You couldn't satisfy this guy.
So, let's see some memes.
Susan Blackmore: Memes and "temes"
So that's what I did.
And here's how it went.
Anyways, I... where to start?
We've got another 10 minutes.
Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.
DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.
So here's what Dan said.
But we're not there yet.
And it's monitoring their reliability.
But that's not electricity yet.
It's fast, it's pretty private.
Many prototypes crashed -- many.
RD: Yeah, yeah. It did.
And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!"
"So biology, genetics?" she said.
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.
So it's got hybrid drive.
So that's it speeded up.
And it's a power park.
Children: One, two, three, go.
So finally, texture is something.
So we're building these buildings.
And that's my final slide.
And here's just one example.
He didn't follow his passion.
We're plugged in; we're connected.
I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.
Now Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.
Robin Ince: Science versus wonder?
Meet Tony. He's my student.
Damon Horowitz: Philosophy in prison
Fundamentally it's a consumption issue.
JP Rangaswami: Information is food
So I'm sorry about that.
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.
True story, by the way.
So that's what Lauren did.
AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.
She goes, "What about dogs?"
They don't want to change.
So it's probably an overestimate.
And that's what happening now.
But there's lots of stuff.
Hold still, you're the scale.
They don't own those facilities.
They don't employ those workers.
Our democracies rely on elections.
And that's the tough part.
But there's no major difference.
Hans Rosling: Religions and babies
And that's what we did.
And let's add satellite confirmation.
From there, we dove in.
And he's on a mission.
You're clear. All right. Firing.
Who's got the hero view?
Your Google Science Fair champions.
