asciminib is an allosteric inhibitor that binds a myristoyl site of the BCR @-@ ABL1 protein , locking BCR @-@ ABL1 into an inactive conformation through a mechanism distinct from those for all other ABL kinase inhibitors .
asciminib targets both native and mutated BCR @-@ ABL1 , including the gatekeeper T315I mutant .
the safety and antileukemic activity of asciminib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome @-@ positive leukemia are unknown .
in this phase 1 , dose @-@ escalation study , we enrolled 141 patients with chronic @-@ phase and 9 with accelerated @-@ phase chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) who had resistance to or unacceptable side effects from at least two previous ATP @-@ competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) .
the primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose ( or both ) of asciminib .
asciminib was administered once or twice daily ( at doses of 10 to 200 mg ) .
the median follow @-@ up was 14 months .
patients were heavily pretreated ; 70 % ( 105 of 150 patients ) had received at least three TKIs .
the maximum tolerated dose of asciminib was not reached .
among patients with chronic @-@ phase CML , 34 ( 92 % ) with a hematologic relapse had a complete hematologic response ; 31 ( 54 % ) without a complete cytogenetic response at baseline had a complete cytogenetic response .
a major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 48 % of patients who could be evaluated , including 8 of 14 ( 57 % ) deemed to have resistance to or unacceptable side effects from ponatinib .
a major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 5 patients ( 28 % ) with a T315I mutation at baseline .
clinical responses were durable ; a major molecular response was maintained in 40 of 44 patients .
dose @-@ limiting toxic effects included asymptomatic elevations in the lipase level and clinical pancreatitis .
common adverse events included fatigue , headache , arthralgia , hypertension , and thrombocytopenia .
asciminib was active in heavily pretreated patients with CML who had resistance to or unacceptable side effects from TKIs , including patients in whom ponatinib had failed and those with a T315I mutation . ( Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02081378 . )
failure of tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy in patients with Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) -positive chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) may result from resistance to or unacceptable side effects from the drug or both .
currently approved TKIs mainly target the ATP @-@ binding site of BCR @-@ ABL1 , and approximately half of clinical resistance is associated with the acquisition of mutations in this region of the kinase , resulting in conformational changes that render TKIs inactive.1 @-@ 6
the " gatekeeper " T315I mutation , reported in approximately 20 % of patients with mutations , is of particular concern because it is associated with resistance to all clinically available TKIs except ponatinib.7 @-@ 9
unacceptable side effects from TKIs also occur in approximately 25 % of patients , with increasing recognition that patients receiving second- and third @-@ generation TKIs are at risk for vascular and pulmonary toxic effects.10 @-@ 14
asciminib ( ABL001 ) is a potent , specific , orally bioavailable BCR @-@ ABL1 inhibitor that is distinct from approved ABL1 kinase inhibitors in that it does not bind to the ATP @-@ binding site of the kinase .
in contrast , asciminib acts as an allosteric inhibitor and engages a vacant pocket at a site of the kinase domain normally occupied by the myristoylated N @-@ terminal of ABL1 - a motif that serves as an allosteric negative regulatory element lost on fusion of ABL1 to BCR ( Figure 1 ) .
by binding the myristoyl site , asciminib mimics myristate and restores inhibition of kinase activity .
owing to the distinct conformation of the myristoyl pocket , asciminib has high selectivity for only ABL1 and , hypothetically , ABL2 kinases , with low @-@ nanomolar @-@ range activity against unmutated BCR @-@ ABL1 and all clinically observed ATP @-@ site mutants , including T315I.15,16
we hypothesized that asciminib may produce clinically significant responses in patients with CML in whom multiple approved TKIs have failed .
we conducted a phase 1 study to determine the safety , maximum tolerated dose or recommended dose , pharmacokinetics , and antileukemic activity of asciminib in patients with Ph @-@ positive leukemia after failure of multiple approved TKIs .
here we report on patients with CML in the chronic or accelerated phase .
the study was designed collaboratively by the sponsor ( Novartis Pharmaceuticals ) and study investigators .
the sponsor collected the data and analyzed them in conjunction with the authors .
the first two authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript .
editorial support was provided by ArticulateScience and funded by the sponsor .
all authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol ( available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org ) .
patients were eligible if they were 18 years of age or older , had Ph @-@ positive chronic @-@ phase or accelerated @-@ phase CML , and had hematologic , cytogenetic , or molecular disease that was relapsed or refractory to at least two different TKIs before study entry or had unacceptable side effects from the TKIs , as determined by investigators according to standard criteria.17
patients with a BCR @-@ ABL1 T315I mutation were eligible after they had received at least one TKI if no other effective therapy was available .
the primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose ( or both ) of asciminib administered twice daily in patients with chronic @-@ phase or accelerated @-@ phase CML .
secondary objectives included assessments of safety , pharmacokinetics , and efficacy .
the study included a dose @-@ escalation phase and an expansion phase for patients treated at either the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose .
data on pharmacokinetics are presented for 110 patients from cycle 1 , day 1 onward ( Table S1 ) .
a two @-@ compartment pharmacokinetic @-@ pharmacodynamic model with linear elimination and distribution was used to inform the recommended dose selection ( see the Supplementary Appendix ) .
antileukemic ACTIVITY
complete blood counts were performed regularly to assess hematologic response .
bone marrow aspirations for morphologic and cytogenetic analyses were performed before therapy and during the study in all patients with BCR @-@ ABL1 transcript levels of more than 1 % on the International Scale ( IS ) or loss of a complete hematologic response , every 3 months in patients without a complete cytogenetic response , and as clinically indicated .
real @-@ time quantitative reverse @-@ transcriptase @-@ polymerase @-@ chain @-@ reaction assays for molecular response were performed every 3 months and as clinically indicated .
responses were defined according to standard criteria.18 @-@ 22
molecular responses were assessed with the ratio of BCR @-@ ABL1 to ABL1 measured on the International Scale ( BCR @-@ ABL1IS ) .22
molecular response was calculated for patients with typical b2a2 or b3a2 BCR @-@ ABL1 transcripts only .
changes in molecular @-@ response category from baseline were assessed with the use of intervals of 1 @-@ log changes in BCR @-@ ABL1 transcript levels by 6 or 12 months ( see the Supplementary Appendix ) .
molecular assessments were performed centrally ( MolecularMD , Portland , Oregon ) .
treatment status and patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Table S2 .
from May 2014 through September 2017 , a total of 141 patients with chronic @-@ phase CML and 9 with accelerated @-@ phase CML were treated with asciminib monotherapy , with a median follow @-@ up of 59 weeks ( range , 0.1 to 167 ) at the time of analysis .
of all 150 patients enrolled , 105 ( 70 % ) had received at least three previous TKIs .
at study entry , 46 patients ( 31 % ) had at least one BCR @-@ ABL1 kinase domain mutation , the most frequent being T315I ( in 33 patients [ 22 % ] ) .
as of September 1 , 2017 , a total of 110 patients ( 73 % ) were continuing study treatment .
of patients who discontinued treatment , 1 died ( after a blast crisis developed ) .
safety PROFILE
in patients with CML treated on a twice @-@ daily schedule , seven dose levels were investigated : 10 mg ( 1 patient ) , 20 mg ( 14 patients ) , 40 mg ( 35 patients ) , 80 mg ( 12 patients ) , 150 mg ( 13 patients ) , 160 mg ( 7 patients ) , and 200 mg ( 16 patients ) .
five dose @-@ limiting toxic effects were reported : grade 3 elevations in the lipase level without clinical pancreatitis in 2 patients receiving 40 mg , grade 2 myalgia and arthralgia in 1 patient receiving 80 mg , grade 3 acute coronary syndrome in 1 patient receiving 150 mg , and grade 3 bronchospasm in 1 patient receiving 200 mg .
in patients treated on a once @-@ daily schedule , three dose levels were investigated : 80 mg ( 18 patients ) , 120 mg ( 22 patients ) , and 200 mg ( 12 patients ) .
three dose @-@ limiting toxic effects occurred in patients receiving 200 mg : a grade 3 elevation in the lipase level associated with clinical pancreatitis , a grade 3 asymptomatic elevation in the lipase level , and grade 3 abdominal pain of undetermined cause .
among all 150 patients who could be evaluated for safety , the most common nonhematologic adverse events that emerged during treatment regardless of dose schedule were asymptomatic elevations in the lipase or amylase level , rash , and constitutional symptoms ( e.g. , fatigue , nausea , headache , and arthralgia ) , of which 92 % were grade 1 or 2 .
hypertension , reported in 19 % of patients , was the most commonly reported cardiovascular adverse event ( Table 2 ) .
clinical pancreatitis , marked by abdominal pain and elevation in the lipase level and confirmed by abdominal imaging , occurred in 5 patients ( 3 patients receiving 80 mg twice daily , 1 receiving 150 mg twice daily , and 1 receiving 200 mg once daily ) ; three cases were reported as serious adverse events ( Table S3 ) .
four of 5 patients had a single episode of pancreatitis , and 1 patient had two episodes of pancreatitis while receiving a reduced dose of asciminib .
all cases resolved within 5 to 10 days after discontinuation of asciminib , and the sole patient rechallenged with asciminib was able to continue treatment at a lower dose .
three of 5 patients had had pancreatitis when using a previous TKI .
asymptomatic biochemical elevations in the lipase or amylase level occurred in 35 additional patients across all doses except 10 mg twice daily .
these events were self @-@ limited and did not progress to clinical pancreatitis .
a total of 10 patients required temporary dose interruptions , and 1 patient discontinued treatment .
hematologic toxic effects that emerged during treatment were common but were typically of grade 1 or 2 ( Table 2 ) .
the preliminary half @-@ life was approximately 8 hours , which suggests a steady state by day 3 .
at a dose of 40 mg twice daily or 80 mg once daily , trough blood concentrations surpassed the preclinical 90 % inhibitory concentration for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( pSTAT5 ) inhibition in a KCL @-@ 22 xenograft animal model ( 121 ng per milliliter ) .
pharmacokinetic @-@ pharmacodynamic model @-@ based predictions indicated that a dose of 40 mg twice daily would maintain 100 % of patients without a T315I mutation above the preclinical 90 % inhibitory concentration for pSTAT5 inhibition .
patients with Chronic @-@ Phase CML without a T315I Mutation
among 113 patients with chronic @-@ phase CML without a T315I mutation receiving asciminib either once or twice daily , 34 of 37 patients ( 92 % ) without a complete hematologic response at baseline had a complete hematologic response ( Table 3 ) .
a major molecular response ( BCR @-@ ABL1IS ≤ 0.1 % ) was achieved or maintained by 6 months in 37 of 99 patients ( 37 % ) who could be evaluated and by 12 months in 44 of 91 patients ( 48 % ) who could be evaluated ( Table 3 and Table S4 ) .
among the latter group of 91 patients , 30 of 40 patients ( 75 % ) with a baseline BCR @-@ ABL1IS of 1 % or less had a major molecular response by 12 months , whereas 14 of 51 patients ( 27 % ) with a BCR @-@ ABL1IS of more than 1 % had a major molecular response by 12 months .
of 85 patients without a deep molecular response ( i.e. , BCR @-@ ABL1IS ≤ 0.01 % ) at baseline , 17 ( 20 % ) had a deep molecular response by 12 months .
by 12 months , 57 of 91 patients ( 63 % ) had an improvement in their molecular @-@ response category ( Table 4 ) .
in addition , a major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 8 of 14 patients ( 57 % ) with chronic @-@ phase CML who were deemed to have resistance to or unacceptable side effects from ponatinib .
among 44 patients in whom a major molecular response was either achieved or maintained , all but 4 continued to receive treatment at the time of analysis ; the median time in which a major molecular response was achieved was 20 weeks ( range , 2 to 120 ) , and the median duration of response was more than 61 weeks ( range , 4 to 154 ) .
in these 4 patients , the major molecular response was lost between 28 and 100 weeks of treatment ; 2 of them remained in the study with a complete cytogenetic response .
a total of 21 of 64 patients ( 33 % ) without detectable mutations and 5 of 8 ( 62 % ) with mutations other than T315I had a major molecular response by 12 months .
hematologic , cytogenetic , and molecular responses were noted across all doses of asciminib administered on once @-@ daily or twice @-@ daily schedules .
patients with Chronic @-@ Phase CML with a T315I Mutation
among 28 patients with chronic @-@ phase CML harboring a T315I mutation , 14 of 16 ( 88 % ) without a complete hematologic response at baseline had a complete hematologic response ( Table 3 ) .
of 22 patients without a complete cytogenetic response at baseline , 9 ( 41 % ) had a complete cytogenetic response ( Table 3 ) in a median time of 8 weeks ( range , 4 to 33 ) .
a major molecular response was achieved in 4 of 17 patients ( 24 % ) and maintained in 1 of 1 patient ( 100 % ) by 12 months , with 9 of 18 ( 50 % ) showing improvement in their molecular @-@ response category by 12 months ( Table 4 ) .
of 5 patients with a T315I mutation who were deemed to have resistance to ponatinib , 1 ( 20 % ) had a major molecular response by 12 months .
three of 4 patients ( 75 % ) with chronic @-@ phase CML with a T315I mutation who had a major molecular response received a dose of more than 150 mg twice daily ( Table S5 ) .
all 5 patients with a T315I mutation in whom a major molecular response was either achieved or maintained continued to receive treatment and were having a response at the time of analysis ; the median time in which a major molecular response was achieved was 14 weeks ( range , 4 to 20 ) , and the median duration of response was more than 25 weeks ( range , 12 to 96 ) .
patients with Accelerated @-@ Phase CML
among nine patients with accelerated @-@ phase CML , seven of eight ( 88 % ) with hematologic disease at baseline had a complete hematologic response , and one of nine ( 11 % ) had a major molecular response , with responses maintained during therapy for a median of more than 11 weeks ( Table 3 ) .
development of Myristoyl @-@ Pocket Mutations
new myristoyl @-@ pocket mutations were detected in 2 of 20 patients who had disease progression during asciminib treatment and in 2 of 66 patients without evidence of disease progression who had received asciminib for at least 12 months at the time of analysis .
four patients whose disease progressed before 12 months were not screened for mutations owing to sample unavailability .
one patient with chronic @-@ phase CML with a BCR @-@ ABL1IS of 8.1 % and a baseline E255K mutation received asciminib at a dose of 40 mg twice daily .
details of the other 3 patients are presented in the Supplementary Appendix .
asciminib had substantial and durable clinical activity in a heavily pretreated population of patients with chronic @-@ phase or accelerated @-@ phase CML in whom treatment with currently available ATP @-@ competitive TKIs had failed .
major side effects were asymptomatic elevations in the lipase or amylase level , rash , and constitutional symptoms ( e.g. , fatigue , nausea , headache , and arthralgia ) , most of which were of grade 1 or 2 and appeared to be equivalent in patients receiving asciminib twice daily and in those receiving the drug once daily .
a maximum tolerated dose was not reached .
clinical pancreatitis was noted in 3 % of patients overall , only at asciminib doses of more than 40 mg twice daily , and was manageable with dose modifications .
myelosuppression was uncommon and mostly of grade 1 and 2 .
among patients with chronic @-@ phase CML without a T315I mutation , the incidences of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response at 12 months were 70 % and 48 % , respectively .
among patients who entered the study with a BCR @-@ ABL1IS of 0.1 % or less at baseline , a deep molecular response was achieved or maintained in 60 % during the study .
although TKI therapy has transformed the natural history of CML , 25 many patients have TKI failure - frequently due to the emergence of resistance mutations in the BCR @-@ ABL1 kinase domain.8,9,26 @-@ 29
in our study , asciminib showed activity in patients with or without BCR @-@ ABL1 kinase domain mutations .
complete cytogenetic and major molecular responses were achieved in patients with chronic @-@ phase CML with a T315I mutation , with the majority of those who had a response receiving asciminib doses of more than 150 mg twice daily , which was higher than the doses required to achieve responses in patients without a T315I mutation .
furthermore , a major molecular response was achieved in some patients with CML who were deemed to have resistance to or unacceptable side effects from ponatinib , which indicates a benefit in patients with limited effective therapeutic options other than stem @-@ cell transplantation .
asciminib was developed to bind to the myristoyl pocket - a previously unexploited feature of ABL1 and ABL2 kinases that is key to physiological autoinhibition of the native kinase .
given the extensive homology between the ATP @-@ binding sites of many human kinases , targeting the myristoyl pocket is predicted to achieve superior selectivity and , hence , reduced toxicity .
asciminib exhibits both in vitro potency similar to that of second @-@ generation TKIs and a resistance profile distinct from that of catalytic @-@ site inhibitors.15,16
although recent in vitro work suggested the potential for a high rate of emergent mutations with inhibition of the myristoyl pocket of BCR @-@ ABL1,30 our early clinical experience does not support this prediction .
to date , myristoyl @-@ pocket mutations have been detected in only 4 of 86 patients receiving asciminib , and clinical responses were maintained in the majority of patients who had a response .
in our study , asciminib monotherapy showed durable clinical activity in most patients with chronic @-@ phase CML .
low @-@ grade , reversible toxic effects occurred in a minority of patients .
in 1928 , Sir Alexander Fleming discovered that the active component of a penicillium fungus had the capacity to kill bacteria in a petri dish , and he named it penicillin .
in 1945 , Fleming , Florey , and Chain were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine " for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases . "
since the early 1950s , penicillin has saved millions of lives , including those of children , pregnant women , and patients with sepsis , meningitis , or endocarditis , among other life @-@ threatening infections .
penicillin G remains the only recommended treatment for the prevention of mother @-@ to @-@ child transmission of syphilis .
the first case of anaphylaxis associated with penicillin was reported in 1945 , and a report from the World Health Organization in 1968 stated that the rate of death from anaphylaxis was 0.002 % .1
no data suggest that the frequency of allergic reactions has increased in the past 60 years , and there is convincing evidence that penicillin sensitization is lost over time.2
anaphylaxis induced by exposure to penicillin has been observed with oral , subcutaneous , and intravenous administration.3
on the basis of a nationwide survey in 1957 , covering 827 hospitals in the United States , it was estimated that a total of 1000 penicillin @-@ related deaths occurred during the first 10 years of penicillin use.1,4
in addition , the increased use of penicillin since 1950 led to estimates that from 1965 to 1968 there had been 300 deaths annually from anaphylactic shock due to penicillin use in the United States , but these data were not verifiable.1
a review of 151 deaths due to penicillin use published in the medical literature between 1951 to 1965 showed no sex predominance1 ; more than 50 % of the persons were between 25 and 65 years of age , 44 % had respiratory infections , 28 % had preexisting allergies or asthma , and 69 % had previous exposure to penicillin , of whom 36 % had had previous reactions to the drug .
the mean interval between the administration of penicillin and the onset of symptoms was less than 15 minutes in 85 % of cases , and most patients died within 1 hour after administration .
current Epidemiology and Geographic Relevance
penicillin is the most common drug allergy identified in medical records , with a prevalence ranging from 6 to 25 % across various regions and treatment populations.5,6
benign cutaneous reactions such as urticaria and delayed maculopapular exanthema are the most common type of reactions .
the incidence of new reports of penicillin allergy in 2007 in the United States was 1.4 % for females and 1.1 % for males in a study that extracted data from the electronic health records of 411,534 patients who had received care from Kaiser Permanente.7
penicillins have been the most common cause of drug @-@ induced fatal and nonfatal anaphylaxis in the United States11,12 and the United Kingdom .
the lowest rate of anaphylaxis is for oral penicillins , with a report from the United Kingdom of one case of fatal anaphylaxis from oral amoxicillin in 35 years and 100 million treatment courses.13
aminopenicillins are among the highest @-@ risk drugs that cause benign delayed exanthems , which commonly occur in the context of acute Epstein @-@ Barr virus infection.14
aminopenicillins are considered the most common cause of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) .15
penicillins have been associated with other severe cutaneous reactions , such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) and the Stevens @-@ Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( SJS @-@ TEN ) .16
penicillin and Beta @-@ Lactams
unlike other beta @-@ lactams , penicillins have a thiazolidine ring , and unlike cephalosporins and carbapenems , they do not have R2 or additional side @-@ chain structures ( Figure 1A ) .
the side chains of penicillins and first @-@ generation cephalosporins are less complex than the side chains of later @-@ generation cephalosporins , and although early studies indicated more than 5 % cross @-@ reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins , contamination of the early cephalosporin preparations with penicillins was suspected.17,18
currently , no more than 2 % of patients with positive reactions to multiple penicillin skin @-@ test reagents have a reaction to cephalosporins , 19 with the exception of patients who are allergic to aminopenicillins but not to benzyl penicillin , penicillin VK , and other penicillins.20
such selective aminopenicillin allergy has been uncommonly reported in the United States21 but appears to account for one third of cases of penicillin allergy in southern Europe , where 25 to 35 % of patients who are selectively allergic to aminopenicillin have cross @-@ reactivity with aminocephalosporins.14,19,20
in 99 % of patients with a history of penicillin allergy , a skin test and a challenge with carbapenems are associated with an acceptable side @-@ effects profile.22
mechanisms of Penicillin Allergy
penicillins are small molecules that have been shown to covalently bind to proteins in plasma and create hapten @-@ carrier complexes ( Figure 1B ) .
the beta @-@ lactam ring binds to lysine residues in serum proteins , and when binding to a polylysine matrix , it creates the major antigenic determinant , penicilloyl polylysine ( Figure 1B ) .24
Haptenation from covalent binding to carboxyl and thiol groups leads to the creation of several minor determinants ( Figure 1B ) .25
the hapten @-@ prohapten model applies to immediate or antibody @-@ mediated penicillin hypersensitivity ( Gell @-@ Coombs type I , II , and III reactions ( Figure 2 ) .
in IgE @-@ mediated reactions , dendritic cells bind and internalize the penicillin @-@ bound proteins for presentation to naive CD4 + T cells ( type 0 helper T cells ) .
in the presence of interleukin @-@ 4 , naive T cells develop into penicillin @-@ specific type 2 helper T ( Th2 ) cells , which then produce interleukin @-@ 4 and interleukin @-@ 13 , inducing differentiation of B cells into plasma cells that secrete penicillin @-@ specific IgE , which binds to Fc epsilon receptors on the surface of basophils and mast cells .
on reexposure , polyvalent penicillin cross @-@ linking of Fc epsilon receptors bound to IgE antibodies induces mast @-@ cell degranulation and the release of soluble inflammatory mediators such as tryptase , histamine , prostaglandins , and leukotrienes , leading to the clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis .
delayed reactions ( Figure 2 ) are often associated with models that involve noncovalent binding , such as the pharmacologic interaction model or alteration of the specificity of the HLA peptide presentation ( altered peptide repertoire model ) .26,27
common phenotypes of penicillin allergy include reactions within 1 to 6 hours after exposure ( e.g. , urticaria and anaphylaxis ) and reactions occurring more than 6 hours after administration of a single dose or after multiple doses ( e.g. , maculopapular exanthems ) .
delayed T @-@ cell @-@ mediated reactions with systemic involvement include severe cutaneous reactions ( SJS @-@ TEN , DRESS , and AGEP ) ( Figure 2 ) .
diagnosis of IgE @-@ Mediated Penicillin Allergy
after years of widespread use of penicillin antibiotics , penicillin reagents to identify the populations at risk for allergic reactions and anaphylaxis were identified.28,29
this led to the initial use of the major determinant ( penicilloyl polylysine ) , which is penicilloyl coupled to lysine for stabilization as a diagnostic agent ; use of a minor @-@ determinant mixture for this purpose began in the early 1960s ( Figure 1B ) .25
a 1971 study of the prospective use of penicillin skin testing with penicilloyl polylysine and a minor @-@ determinant mixture in nonconsecutive , hospitalized patients with a clinical indication for the therapeutic use of penicillin identified 54 patients with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity but nonreactive skin tests who were treated with penicillin ; only 1 patient had a reaction ( urticaria and arthralgias within 24 hours after therapy ) .30
on the basis of this study and others , the positive predictive value for penicillin skin testing with these reagents was established at 50 to 75 % , and the negative predictive value at more than 93 % .21,30
penicillin Skin Testing for IgE @-@ Mediated Reactions
drug challenges with penicillin are considered the reference standard for assessing tolerance of the drug .
challenges can be performed by administering increasing amounts of drug over time ( e.g. , one tenth of the dose followed after 30 minutes to 1 hour by the full dose ) or administering a single full dose followed by at least 1 hour of observation .
most recent studies of penicillin skin testing have evaluated the negative predictive value after a penicillin challenge .
the current negative predictive value with the use of a complete set of major and minor determinants is estimated at approximately 98 % , with a 2 to 3 % rate of false negative reactions after penicillin challenge and generally mild cutaneous reactions.21
in the United States , a complete panel of minor determinants that includes amoxicillin has never been commercially available ; penicilloyl polylysine and benzyl penicillin are the most common reagents used to assess penicillin allergy .
of globally available reagents for skin testing , penicilloyl polylysine used as the major determinant and benzyl penicillin used as one minor determinant , followed by amoxicillin challenge , have been shown to have a negative predictive value of more than 95 % in non @-@ high @-@ risk populations with a history of remote penicillin reactions .
in Europe and Australia , selective sensitization to aminopenicillins and occasionally clavulanic acid in patients with negative results of skin testing with penicilloyl polylysine and a minor @-@ determinant mixture has been described more frequently , with all these reagents commercially available for testing.31
patients with side chain @-@ specific reactions appear to be less common in the United States .
however , a panel with minor determinants that included amoxicillin would yield more confidence for testing in high @-@ risk patients ( Figure 1B ) , and a complete testing kit is currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.21
in the absence of the global availability of these reagents , the use of an ingestion challenge with amoxicillin after negative penicillin skin testing with penicilloyl polylysine and benzyl penicillin is considered an acceptable method to examine the possibility of an IgE @-@ mediated reaction to amoxicillin and other penicillins , although patients with serious or recent IgE @-@ mediated reactions are excluded from testing .
direct Challenge without Skin Testing for Children
penicillin skin testing is safe and effective in the evaluation of children with a history of penicillin allergy.32
a retrospective cohort study involving 369 children with negative penicillin skin tests who were challenged with penicillin showed that 14 patients ( 3.8 % ) had a mild reaction.32
given the current low prevalence of confirmed penicillin allergy , several studies have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of performing direct penicillin challenges without initial skin testing .
the majority of these studies have involved children with a low rate of confirmed penicillin allergy , even when tested 2 months after a benign exanthem in reaction to amoxicillin.18
in a prospective and retrospective observational study involving 818 young children with a history of low @-@ risk reactions to amoxicillin ( no children with a history of anaphylaxis were included ) , Mill et al. performed amoxicillin challenges with two graded doses administered 20 minutes apart .
the authors reported that 2.1 % of the children had immediate reactions , and 3.8 % had nonimmediate mild reactions.33
Ibáñez et al. performed a prospective multicenter study that included 732 children with a history of mild reactions to penicillins .
using a multistep challenge to the culprit penicillin , the authors found that 0.8 % of the children had immediate reactions and 4.0 % had delayed reactions , with one patient requiring epinephrine treatment.34
these and other studies suggest that a direct penicillin challenge without skin testing is probably appropriate for children with a history of a benign rash but without a history of anaphylaxis ( Figure 3 ) .
however , all studies to date that have examined direct penicillin challenges have been performed either by allergy specialists or in urgent care settings , and the safety of such challenges when they are performed in nonspecialty clinics and in adult populations is unknown.14
other indications for direct challenges include a recorded history of penicillin allergy involving symptoms that are not suggestive of allergy ( e.g. , nausea or headache ) , a family history of penicillin allergy , unknown reactions , and pruritus without rash .
a direct penicillin challenge as a general approach is not recommended until larger studies can confirm its safety and effectiveness ( Figure 3 ) .
testing for Delayed Penicillin Allergy
skin @-@ testing procedures for delayed reactions to penicillins include patch , delayed prick , and intradermal testing ( Figure 3 ) .27
a prospective , 3 @-@ year , multicenter study that was performed to determine the sensitivity of patch testing in identifying the culprit for severe cutaneous drug reactions suggested that the sensitivity of delayed intradermal testing may exceed that of patch testing , particularly for maculopapular exanthems , DRESS , and AGEP.35
patch testing has poor sensitivity for SJS @-@ TEN ( < 40 % ) , and delayed intradermal testing is not recommended because of anecdotal reports of reproduction of initial reactions .
in vitro tests for delayed reactions are only available in research or specialty centers , and their sensitivity and specificity vary according to the drug and the specific test .
these tests are performed by exposing the patient 's lymphocytes to the implicated drug .
they include the lymphocyte transformation test , which measures the proliferation of the patient 's T cells over a period of 5 to 7 days , 36 and the enzyme @-@ linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISPOT ) test , which detects antigen @-@ specific , cytokine @-@ producing cells after 24 hours of incubation with polymorphonuclear blood cells .
both tests are performed in the presence of the implicated drugs.36
genetic Risk
the discovery of HLA associations with drug hypersensitivity syndromes has provided screening strategies to improve drug safety and has increased our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of delayed drug reactions.26
there have been no significant genetic associations for immediate allergic reactions to penicillins , and candidate gene studies have shown the strongest association with genes involved in IgE synthesis , HLA class II antigen presentation , and cytokines such as interleukins 4 , 10 , and 18 ; however , none are currently in use for prevention or diagnosis.37
drug @-@ induced liver injury related to flucloxacillin , a semisynthetic antistaphylococcal penicillin in use in the United Kingdom , Europe , and Australia , has been strongly associated with HLA @-@ B * 57 : 01 in a genomewide association study , 38 and drug @-@ induced liver injury associated with amoxicillin @-@ clavulanic acid has been associated in multiple studies with HLA @-@ DRB1 * 15 : 01 and its haplotype , DQB1 * 06 : 02 , and with HLA @-@ A * 02 : 01 in northern European populations.26,39
drug @-@ induced liver injury is selective for these drugs on the basis of HLA restriction , and no cross @-@ reactivity with other beta @-@ lactams is apparent .
given the low positive predictive value of these HLA alleles for drug @-@ induced liver injury ( < 1 % ) , testing for them as a means to determine the possible presence of penicillin allergy is not currently used in routine clinical practice .
natural History of Penicillin Allergy
the natural history of IgE @-@ mediated penicillin allergy has been the most extensively studied hypersensitivity reaction .
in 1981 , a retrospective study from the United States showed that the prevalence of positive penicillin skin tests was lower among patients who were tested 10 years or more after a documented reaction than among patients who were tested 7 to 12 months after a reaction ( prevalence , 22 % vs. 73 % ) .40
a prospective longitudinal study from Spain followed 31 patients with positive penicillin skin tests and showed that at 1 year , 81 % of the patients had positive tests , and at 5 years , 12 of 18 patients ( 67 % ) continued to have positive skin tests , indicating a loss of penicillin @-@ specific IgE over time.41
a similar decline in the rate of positive skin tests over time has been shown for cephalosporins , although patients with positive skin tests for both penicillin and cephalosporins take longer to lose their sensitivity than patients sensitized only to cephalosporins.42
some children with a history of serum sickness @-@ like reactions to amoxicillin have been shown to have no such reactions to amoxicillin when challenged , suggesting that the reaction is not durable ; consideration should be given to future penicillin skin testing , an ingestion challenge , or both in this population.43
the natural history of serious cutaneous reactions to penicillins is still unknown .
clinical Implications of a Penicillin @-@ Allergy Label
patients with penicillin allergy receive more vancomycin , fluoroquinolones , and clindamycin than patients without the allergy.6
penicillin is the drug of choice for syphilis44 and other infections , and a label of penicillin allergy has associated implications , which have not always been fully appreciated ( Figure 4 ) .
among patients with methicillin @-@ susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections , the risk of death in 30 days is lower with beta @-@ lactam therapy than with vancomycin , 45 and a higher rate of clinical failure with non @-@ beta @-@ lactam antibiotics for bloodstream infections with gram @-@ negative bacilli has been observed.46
decision @-@ analysis models project that patients with methicillin @-@ susceptible S. aureus bacteremia will have inferior outcomes if treated with vancomycin instead of having their penicillin allergy evaluated.47
case @-@ control studies in the United States and United Kingdom that involved more than 50,000 patients labeled as allergic to penicillin showed increased rates of infection with methicillin @-@ resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) , vancomycin @-@ resistant enterococcus , and Clostridioides difficile ( formerly Clostridium difficile ) .6,48
prolonged hospitalizations and increased readmission rates have also been reported among patients with a penicillin @-@ allergy label.6,49
surgical @-@ site infections are reported to be 50 % higher among patients with a penicillin @-@ allergy label than among those without such a label.50
a label of penicillin allergy is also costly .
several studies from North America and Europe have documented higher costs of inpatient and outpatient care for patients with penicillin allergy , 51,52 and it is estimated that penicillin @-@ allergy testing and delabeling lead to cost savings , with the largest study showing a reduction in total health care expenses of $ 1,915 ( in U.S. dollars ) per patient per year.53 @-@ 55
penicillin @-@ Allergy Assessment in Antibiotic Stewardship Programs
in contemporary clinical practice , more than 90 % of patients labeled as allergic to penicillin can safely receive the drug .
this observation , coupled with the estimate that , on average , 8 to 15 % of unselected international patients are labeled as allergic to penicillin ( Figure 4 ) , 56 indicates that many patients labeled as allergic to penicillin could safely receive it .
the high burden of penicillin @-@ allergy labeling and the increasing evidence of associated adverse personal and public health consequences provide the rationale for a formalized , hospital @-@ based process to prioritize assessment of penicillin allergy as part of an antibiotic stewardship program .
since the majority of adults with a penicillin @-@ allergy label acquired it in childhood and since more than 90 % of patients labeled as allergic to penicillin can have the label removed , 57 there is an opportunity to integrate risk @-@ based and formalized testing strategies into antibiotic stewardship programs to target populations with the greatest need for antibiotics and at the highest risk for the development of antibiotic resistance and other conditions , such as C. difficile infection.58
retrospective and observational data suggest that direct oral @-@ challenge procedures may be safe in the lowest @-@ risk populations , including patients with a remote or unknown history of allergy or a mild cutaneous reaction.33,59,60
given the large number of labeled patients globally , an evidence base is needed to guide the safest , most effective approach to delabel patients with penicillin allergy in the context of these formalized programs .
best Clinical Practices for Removing the Penicillin @-@ Allergy Label
several methods have been used to remove penicillin @-@ allergy labels in both inpatient and outpatient populations ( Figure 3 ) .
these include the use of allergy @-@ trained clinical pharmacists to perform preemptive testing in patients with a history of penicillin allergy who are at high risk for antibiotic use , 61 the use of clinical decision @-@ support tools and specific algorithms for penicillin testing , 54 and the use of penicillin skin @-@ testing consultation through telemedicine ( since there is a paucity of allergy specialists ) .62,63
a systematic review of inpatient penicillin testing , including studies in intensive care units , confirmed the safety and effectiveness of this approach in removing the penicillin @-@ allergy label , with 95 % of patients having negative skin tests.56
more recently , algorithms or pathways have been developed to guide nonallergist practitioners on the use of antibiotics in patients labeled as having penicillin allergy , with risk assessment based on the clinical history , the timing and phenotype of the reaction , and the associated coexisting conditions.64
delabeling is accomplished with the use of oral or intravenous test doses and challenges for low @-@ risk patients and with the use of skin testing for high @-@ risk patients .
a study of a decision @-@ support pathway developed as part of a guideline for antibiotic prescription at several Partners HealthCare teaching hospitals in Boston showed that house officers administered more cephalosporin test doses to patients labeled as having penicillin allergy after implementation of the guideline , with a resultant reduction in the use of vancomycin , aztreonam , and fluoroquinolones.65
a follow @-@ up study from the same investigators compared the use of penicillin skin testing and a computerized guideline with usual care and showed that both approaches led to higher rates of use of third- and fourth @-@ generation cephalosporins , but only the skin @-@ test group had a higher rate of penicillin use at discharge.66
such decision @-@ support pathways improve antimicrobial stewardship67 but do not lead to systematic removal of the penicillin @-@ allergy label .
evaluation of penicillin allergy in outpatient clinics and the use of alerts in electronic health records have facilitated the assessment of penicillin allergy preoperatively.60,68,69
the use of an amoxicillin challenge without a penicillin skin test was associated with low morbidity in a cohort of marines who had a history of selective penicillin allergy70 and in children with a history of low @-@ risk symptoms of penicillin allergy.71
however , larger studies are needed to assess safety in these and other populations .
penicillin Desensitization
patients with IgE @-@ dependent penicillin allergy , including anaphylaxis , who require penicillin as first @-@ line therapy are candidates for rapid desensitization ( Figure 3 and Table 1 and Table 2 ) .
the first penicillin desensitization , attributed to O 'Donovan during World War II , was performed by adding increasing amounts of oral penicillin to milk until the target dose was reached without side effects in a soldier who had had an anaphylactic reaction to intramuscular penicillin.29
since then , numerous patients have been successfully desensitized with intramuscular , intravenous , and oral protocols.73
the mechanisms of rapid desensitization have been studied in cellular and animal models , 74 which have led to the development of clinical protocols.75
in 2009 , Legere et al. successfully desensitized 15 patients who had cystic fibrosis and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of less than 1 liter , including 1 patient who underwent desensitization during lung transplantation , using a standard 12 @-@ step , three @-@ bag protocol , in which the concentration in each successive bag increased by a factor of 10 and doses doubled every 15 minutes until the target dose was reached in 6 hours.76
this and similar protocols have been used for intravenous and oral penicillin desensitization ( Table 1 and 2 ) with 100 % success , allowing administration of the target dose and maintenance of first @-@ line therapy .
desensitization has temporary effects that last for at least two dosing intervals of the drug , after which desensitization needs to be repeated .
long @-@ acting benzathine penicillin is associated with an acceptable adverse @-@ events profile 1 to 3 weeks after penicillin desensitization.73
empirical desensitization in the absence of positive skin tests does not answer the question of whether a patient is truly allergic to penicillin , and follow @-@ up for formal penicillin allergy testing is recommended after completion of the penicillin treatment course .
the incidence of both IgE @-@ mediated and non @-@ IgE @-@ mediated reactions has not increased worldwide in the past 50 years , and a penicillin @-@ allergy label has serious consequences for both individual and public health ( Figure 4 ) .
although a large number of patients are labeled as having penicillin allergy , more than 95 % of them can safely receive penicillin when they are appropriately and safely evaluated .
penicillin allergy is lost over time , and using sensitive and specific tools to identify patients with true reactions should be a health priority implemented through delabeling algorithms and programs .
over time , it would be expected that delabeling patients who no longer have penicillin allergy will control the use of alternative and more expensive antibiotics and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality and the surge of organisms that are resistant to penicillin and beta @-@ lactams .
protection of patients who are truly allergic to penicillin by means of accurate diagnosis , proper labeling , and if necessary , desensitization should be the next steps toward improved safety and quality of care in personalized medicine .
allergists should have a central role in facilitating outpatient and inpatient testing programs aimed at correctly identifying patients with penicillin allergy ( Figure 3 ) .
through appropriate history taking and risk stratification to identify patients without IgE @-@ mediated allergy , as well as low @-@ risk patients , all health care providers can play a central role in alleviating the enormous individual and public health burden related to the penicillin @-@ allergy label .
moderate therapeutic hypothermia is currently recommended to improve neurologic outcomes in adults with persistent coma after resuscitated out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest .
however , the effectiveness of moderate therapeutic hypothermia in patients with nonshockable rhythms ( asystole or pulseless electrical activity ) is debated .
we performed an open @-@ label , randomized , controlled trial comparing moderate therapeutic hypothermia ( 33 ° C during the first 24 hours ) with targeted normothermia ( 37 ° C ) in patients with coma who had been admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) after resuscitation from cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm .
the primary outcome was survival with a favorable neurologic outcome , assessed on day 90 after randomization with the use of the Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) scale ( which ranges from 1 to 5 , with higher scores indicating greater disability ) .
we defined a favorable neurologic outcome as a CPC score of 1 or 2 .
outcome assessment was blinded .
mortality and safety were also assessed .
from January 2014 through January 2018 , a total of 584 patients from 25 ICUs underwent randomization , and 581 were included in the analysis ( 3 patients withdrew consent ) .
on day 90 , a total of 29 of 284 patients ( 10.2 % ) in the hypothermia group were alive with a CPC score of 1 or 2 , as compared with 17 of 297 ( 5.7 % ) in the normothermia group ( difference , 4.5 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.1 to 8.9 ; P = 0.04 ) .
mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between the hypothermia group and the normothermia group ( 81.3 % and 83.2 % , respectively ; difference , − 1.9 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 8.0 to 4.3 ) .
the incidence of prespecified adverse events did not differ significantly between groups .
among patients with coma who had been resuscitated from cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm , moderate therapeutic hypothermia at 33 ° C for 24 hours led to a higher percentage of patients who survived with a favorable neurologic outcome at day 90 than was observed with targeted normothermia . ( Funded by the French Ministry of Health and others ; HYPERION ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01994772 . )
in accordance with the 2015 guidelines of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation ( ILCOR ) , 1 targeted temperature management with a target of 32 ° C to 36 ° C ( moderate therapeutic hypothermia ) is currently advocated for all patients with coma after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest .
trial results published in 2013 , however , showed inconclusive effects of this treatment in the 19 % of patients who had cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm ( asystole or pulseless electrical activity ) , 2 and the use of hypothermia subsequently decreased in this situation.3 @-@ 5
two retrospective case @-@ series studies suggested beneficial effects of hypothermia on both neurologic outcomes and survival among these patients , 6,7 two showed no effect , 8,9 and two suggested harm.10,11
this uncertainty requires resolution , because nonshockable rhythms now predominate among patients with cardiac arrest12 and are associated with a poor prognosis , with only 2 to 15 % of patients having good neurologic outcomes , 2,13,14 as compared with nearly 65 % of patients who have cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm.15
finally , data on moderate therapeutic hypothermia are limited in patients with cardiac arrest due to noncardiac causes or in those with in @-@ hospital cardiac arrest .
the objective of the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest in Nonshockable Rhythm ( HYPERION ) trial was to assess whether moderate therapeutic hypothermia at 33 ° C , as compared with targeted normothermia ( 37 ° C ) , would improve neurologic outcome in patients with coma who had been successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm .
we conducted this investigator @-@ initiated , open @-@ label , blinded @-@ outcome @-@ assessor , pragmatic , multicenter , randomized , controlled trial in 25 intensive care units ( ICUs ) in France ( 11 in university hospitals and 14 in community hospitals ) .
the trial rationale and design have been described previously.16
the research protocol ( available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org ) was approved by the appropriate ethics committees and French data @-@ protection authorities .
the trial was supported by independent research grants from the French Ministry of Health , the nonprofit health care institution Centre Hospitalier Départemental Vendée , and the Laerdal Foundation .
none of the trial funders had any role in the trial design , the collection or analysis of the data , or the writing of the manuscript .
the authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol .
candidates for trial enrollment were 18 years of age or older and had been resuscitated from out @-@ of @-@ hospital or in @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm due to any cause .
eligible patients had coma ( score ≤ 8 on the Glasgow Coma Scale [ GCS ] ; scores range from 3 to 15 , with lower scores indicating poorer function ) at ICU admission .
in patients who had been sedated before ICU admission , the GCS score that had been determined by the emergency physician just before sedation was used .
exclusion criteria were a no @-@ flow time ( from collapse to initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ CPR ] ) of more than 10 minutes ; a low @-@ flow time ( from initiation of CPR to return of spontaneous circulation ) of more than 60 minutes ; major hemodynamic instability ( continuous epinephrine or norepinephrine infusion > 1 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute ) ; time from cardiac arrest to screening of more than 300 minutes ; moribund condition ; Child @-@ Pugh class C cirrhosis of the liver ( severe hepatic dysfunction ) ; pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding ; status of being under guardianship ; status of being an inmate at a correctional facility ; previous inclusion in another randomized , controlled trial involving patients with cardiac arrest in which the neurologic outcome at 90 days was assessed as the primary end point ; lack of health insurance ; and decision by the next of kin for the patient not to participate .
according to French law , because the strategies used in both groups were considered to be components of standard care , informed consent for trial participation was not required .
however , French data @-@ protection authorities require that patients be given the opportunity to decline that their data be used .
therefore , since the patients had coma , it was required that the closest available relatives receive specific information about trial enrollment .
patients with no available relative were included in the trial , were informed as soon as they regained competence , and were asked whether they wanted to remain in the trial ; if the answer was negative , they were excluded from the analysis .
at each center , eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to either moderate therapeutic hypothermia ( 33 ° C ) or targeted normothermia ( 37 ° C ) .
randomization was conducted with the use of a Web @-@ based system that was accessible 24 hours per day .
the randomization sequence was generated by the statistician ( who was not involved in the recruitment of patients ) , with permuted blocks of varying sizes and with stratification according to center and cause of cardiac arrest ( presumed cardiac vs. presumed noncardiac ) .
it was not feasible for the staff who were providing patient care to be unaware of the group assignments .
however , the psychologist who assessed the trial outcomes in all patients was unaware of the group assignments .
targeted TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
the trial protocol involved the standardization of several variables including sedation , neuromuscular blockade , 17 and the management of expected adverse events .
details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org .
in patients who had been assigned to the hypothermia group , hypothermia at 33 ° C ( with a window of ± 0.5 ° C ) was induced and then maintained for 24 hours .
each center followed its standard protocol ( active internal cooling with a specific device , active external cooling with a specific device , or active external cooling without a specific device ) .
slow rewarming was then performed at a rate of 0.25 to 0.50 ° C per hour , to 36.5 to 37.5 ° C , which was maintained for 24 hours .
sedation was provided according to the standard protocol in each center , with dosage adjustment to obtain a Richmond Agitation @-@ Sedation Scale score of − 5 ( on a scale from − 5 [ unresponsive ] to + 4 [ combative ] ) .18
during rewarming , sedation was tapered when the body temperature rose above 36 ° C .
in patients who had been assigned to the normothermia group , body temperature was maintained at 36.5 to 37.5 ° C for 48 hours according to the standard protocol in each ICU .
sedation was given routinely only during the first 12 hours after randomization , in accordance with 2010 ILCOR guidelines.19
assessment OF NEUROLOGIC PROGNOSIS AND LIFE @-@ SUPPORT WITHDRAWAL
decisions regarding limitation of treatment followed current guidelines.1,19
a multimodal assessment of neurologic prognosis was performed , with the contribution of an independent consultant if needed .
all patient data that were available on the day of the decision were evaluated .
details on the decision @-@ making process and on implementation of the decision were recorded .
additional information is provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
all surviving patients were followed until day 90 after randomization .
the primary outcome was survival with a favorable day @-@ 90 neurologic outcome , which was assessed with the use of the Cerebral Performance Category ( CPC ) scale ( scores range from 1 to 5 , with higher scores indicating greater disability ) .
for this trial , a favorable neurologic outcome was defined as a CPC score of 1 ( good cerebral performance or minor disability ) or 2 ( moderate disability ) .20
the CPC score at 90 days was assessed during a semistructured telephone interview adapted from the validated French version21 of the 5 @-@ item Glasgow Outcome Scale22 by a single psychologist who was unaware of the group assignments and who had been specifically trained for the trial.23
the secondary outcomes were mortality , mechanical ventilation duration , length of stay in the ICU and hospital , infections , and hematologic adverse events .
the results of two interim analyses , performed after the inclusion of 200 and 400 patients , were provided to an independent data and safety monitoring board but not to the investigators .
the Peto and Haybittle rule25 was applied , with the significance level set at 0.001 for both interim analyses , and the significance level associated with the final analysis was set at 0.049 to maintain an overall type I error of 5 % .
categorical variables were described with the use of numbers and percentages , and continuous variables with the use of medians and interquartile ranges .
to estimate the treatment effect on the primary outcome , we estimated the between @-@ group difference and its 95 % confidence interval using a linear model with an identity link function .
missing data were handled by assuming that patients with missing data had died .
to assess the consistency of the treatment effect on the primary outcome across prespecified subgroups , differences in percentages and 95 % confidence intervals across subgroups were assessed by linear models with identity link functions including interaction terms .
an additional analysis was performed with respect to the primary outcome and was adjusted for stratification variables ( trial center and cardiac vs. noncardiac cause of arrest ) with the use of a linear model with an identity link function .
secondary outcomes that were expressed as proportions with their 95 % confidence intervals were compared between groups .
secondary outcomes that were reported as cumulative incidences were analyzed with the use of the competing @-@ risks approach , with death , ICU discharge , and hospital discharge as the competing risks .
confidence intervals for the secondary efficacy end points were not adjusted for multiplicity , and therefore inferences drawn from these intervals may not be reproducible .
we used SAS software , version 9.4 ( SAS Institute ) , and R software , version 3.3.1 , for the statistical analyses .
the characteristics of the patients at baseline were evenly balanced between the groups ( Table 1 and Table S2 ) .
cardiac arrest occurred in the hospital in 27.4 % of the patients and out of the hospital in 72.6 % .
the cause of cardiac arrest was noncardiac in two thirds of the patients ; circulatory shock was present in 58 % of the patients .
temperature MANAGEMENT
in the hypothermia group , cooling began a median of 16 minutes ( interquartile range , 0 to 53 ) after randomization and was stopped prematurely in 36 of 284 patients ( 12.7 % ) ; reasons are given in Table S3 .
cooling was achieved with the use of an intravascular cooling catheter in 43 patients ( 15.1 % ) in the hypothermia group and in 44 of 297 patients ( 14.8 % ) in the normothermia group ; with the use of a dedicated closed @-@ loop surface device in 136 ( 47.9 % ) and 101 ( 34.0 % ) , respectively ; and with the use of a basic external cooling device with no closed loop in 105 ( 37.0 % ) and 151 ( 50.8 % ) ( data were missing for 1 patient [ 0.3 % ] in the normothermia group ) ( Table S4 ) .
Figure 2 shows the temperature changes over time ; the mean ( ± SD ) temperature between 12 and 24 hours after randomization was 33.5 ± 1.1 ° C in the hypothermia group and 37.0 ± 0.7 ° C in the normothermia group .
Figures S1 and S2 show the lowest and highest temperatures recorded daily after day 3 .
on day 90 , of the 284 patients who had been assigned to the hypothermia group and were included in the analysis , 29 had a CPC score of 1 or 2 , as compared with 17 of the 297 patients who had been assigned to the normothermia group ( 10.2 % vs. 5.7 % ; difference , 4.5 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.1 to 8.9 ; P = 0.04 ) ( Table 2 and Figure 3 ) .
similar results were obtained in the analysis that was adjusted for stratification variables ( between @-@ group difference , 4.9 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 0.5 to 9.3 ; P = 0.03 ) .
the number of patients who died within 90 days was 231 in the hypothermia group and 247 in the normothermia group ( 81.3 % vs. 83.2 % ; difference , − 1.9 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 8.0 to 4.4 ) .
neither the duration of mechanical ventilation nor the length of stay in the ICU differed substantially between the two groups among patients who survived or among those who died ( Table 2 ) .
additional details on neurologic outcomes and sources of follow @-@ up information are provided in Table 2 , Figure 3 , and Table S5 .
there were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of patients who had any of the prespecified serious adverse events ( Table S6 ) .
Figure S4 shows the changes between day 0 and day 7 in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score ( scores range from 0 to 20 , with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction ) .
causes OF DEATH
of the 581 patients , 478 ( 82.3 % ) died during follow @-@ up .
Table S7 reports the causes of death .
the most common cause of death was withdrawal of life support , which occurred in 143 of 231 patients ( 61.9 % ) in the hypothermia group and in 161 of 247 patients ( 65.2 % ) in the normothermia group .
Figure S5 and Table S8 provide details about the methods used to assess neurologic prognosis , and Figure S6 shows the time from randomization to withdrawal of life support .
in this open @-@ label , multicenter , randomized , controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment , the targeting of a temperature of 33 ° C in patients who had cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm significantly improved survival with a favorable day @-@ 90 neurologic outcome as assessed with the use of the CPC scale , as compared with targeted normothermia .
overall mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between the two groups .
we detected no significant harmful effects of hypothermia at 33 ° C as compared with targeted normothermia .
cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm usually occurs outside the hospital , is often due to noncardiac causes , and is associated with a poorer neurologic prognosis than cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm .
in two pioneer trials comparing hypothermia with normothermia in patients with cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm , neurologic outcomes were good in 26 % and 39 % of patients who were treated with normothermia.26,27
in a post hoc analysis2 of the TTM ( Target Temperature Management 33 ° C versus 36 ° C after Out @-@ of @-@ Hospital Cardiac Arrest ) trial by Nielsen et al . , 28 hypothermia did not improve survival or neurologic outcomes in the group with nonshockable rhythms .
improvements in outcomes after cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm29 may make cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm the situation that is most likely to benefit from hypothermia .
in our trial , the cardiac arrest occurred outside the hospital in approximately three quarters of the patients , and the presumed cause of cardiac arrest was noncardiac in two thirds of the patients .
in a retrospective registry study involving patients with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest , hypothermia was associated with neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge that were poorer than those associated with no specific temperature @-@ management strategy.11
another registry study involving patients with in @-@ hospital cardiac arrest in any rhythm showed poorer neurologic outcomes and survival with hypothermia than with no specific temperature @-@ management strategy.10
however , no details were supplied about the hypothermia methods , temperatures achieved , or temperature management in patients who did not receive hypothermia .
in addition , although propensity @-@ score matching was used , the differences between the two groups suggest missed confounders , such as bystander resuscitation and no @-@ flow duration .
cardiac arrest is a highly heterogeneous entity , and many factors may affect the efficacy of hypothermia .
in a retrospective cohort study , the efficacy of hypothermia increased with no @-@ flow duration , 30 although this result was not replicated in a post hoc analysis of the TTM trial.31
moderate therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to improve neurologic outcomes in patients with severe ischemia @-@ reperfusion brain injury.32,33
we consequently included patients with worse cardiopulmonary @-@ resuscitation characteristics , such as long no @-@ flow and low @-@ flow times and high epinephrine doses , as well as a larger proportion of patients with circulatory shock ( 58 % in our trial vs. 15 % in the TTM trial28 ) .
no @-@ flow and low @-@ flow times are very difficult to determine accurately.34
it is possible that a global predictor such as the Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis score35 may prove useful in the future for constituting uniform patient groups .
moderate therapeutic hypothermia improved the neurologic prognosis but not survival at 90 days , whereas the opposite has been reported for epinephrine.36
the number needed to treat for one additional patient to survive with a CPC score of 1 or 2 is 22 with hypothermia , as compared with a number needed to treat to prevent one death of 15 with bystander CPR37 and 112 with epinephrine.36
our trial has several limitations .
first , the primary outcome was assessed during a telephone interview rather than a face @-@ to @-@ face interview .
second , a substantial proportion of patients had body temperatures above 38 ° C , notably after the period of targeted temperature management .
we chose 37 ° C as the target in the control group to avoid hyperthermia during the period of targeted temperature management.38
third , we used targeted temperature management for 56 to 64 hours in the hypothermia group and for 48 hours in the normothermia group to avoid rebound hyperthermia.39
data to indicate that prolonging targeted temperature management beyond 48 hours may help to prevent or treat neurologic injuries are limited.15,28
fourth , patients with missing data were assumed to have died .
however , only three patients ( one in the hypothermia group and two in the normothermia group ) had missing data .
last , the fragility index value of 1 for our trial indicates that an outcome change in a single patient would make the difference in the primary outcome nonsignificant .
however , all three patients who withdrew consent were in the hypothermia group .
the point estimate for the absolute between @-@ group difference in the frequency of a good outcome of 4.5 percentage points ( 95 % CI , 0.1 to 8.9 ) in favor of hypothermia as compared with the 5.7 % frequency with normothermia is of clinical importance ( which is different from statistical significance ) .40
in conclusion , among patients with coma who had been resuscitated from in @-@ hospital or out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm due to cardiac or noncardiac causes , the use of moderate therapeutic hypothermia at 33 ° C led to a higher percentage of patients who survived with a favorable neurologic outcome at day 90 than was observed with targeted normothermia .
at 12 weeks , patients taking resmetirom had improved fat density , liver enzymes , and serum fibrosis markers .
resmetirom ( MGL @-@ 3196 ) is an oral , liver @-@ directed , selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist .
it regulates metabolic pathways in the liver that are impaired in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease .
in an industry @-@ funded , 36 @-@ week , phase II trial conducted across 25 U.S. sites , researchers assessed the safety and efficacy of resmetirom in patients with biopsy @-@ proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , fibrosis stage 1 to 3 , and at least 10 % hepatic fat fraction ( assessed by MRI @-@ proton density fat fraction ) .
patients were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive resmetirom 80 mg ( n = 84 ) or placebo ( n = 41 ) orally once daily .
resmetirom dose was adjusted ( range , 40 @-@ 100 mg ) at week 4 based on serum drug concentration measured at week 2 .
the relative reduction in fat density fraction from baseline was significantly greater in resmetirom versus placebo recipients at week 12 ( primary endpoint ; − 32.9 % vs. − 10.4 % , respectively ) and week 36 ( − 37.3 % vs. − 8.9 % ) .
liver enzymes and serum markers of fibrosis were also decreased with resmetirom .
on follow @-@ up biopsy at 36 weeks , histologic features of NASH were improved in the resmetirom group ; however , fibrosis stage change did not differ between groups .
resmetirom was well tolerated .
these results suggest that a 36 @-@ week course of resmetirom therapy leads to improvement in fat density , liver enzymes , serum fibrosis markers , and histologic elements of NASH compared with placebo .
improvement in fibrosis was not evident , likely due to the short duration of therapy .
these promising results have led to the initiation of a phase III study in NASH patients with stage 2 or 3 fibrosis ( NCT03900429 ) .
the incidence of recurrent stroke was not significantly lower when a systolic BP target of 120 mm Hg was used , compared with a higher target .
in the only large randomized trial in which researchers compared two blood pressure ( BP ) goals for long @-@ term secondary prevention after stroke ( < 130 vs. 130 @-@ 149 mm Hg ) , the incidence of recurrent stroke was not significantly lower with more @-@ intensive treatment ( Lancet 2013 ; 382 : 507 ) .
now , in a study from Japan , nearly 1300 patients with recent stroke ( 85 % ischemic , 15 % hemorrhagic ) and BP > 130 / 80 mm Hg were randomized to a long @-@ term target of < 120 / 80 mm Hg or < 140 / 90 mm Hg .
most patients had received hypertension treatment prior to their strokes .
the study included a stepwise protocol for drug titration .
during mean follow @-@ up of 4 years , average systolic BP was significantly lower with more @-@ intensive than with less @-@ intensive treatment ( 126.7 vs. 133.2 mm Hg ) ; diastolic BP was 77 mm Hg in both groups .
however , a difference in incidence of recurrent stroke was not statistically significant ( 6.2 % and 8.2 % ; P = 0.15 ) .
in subgroup analysis , incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage was lower in the more @-@ intensively treated group ( 0.2 % vs. 1.7 % ; P = 0.02 ) , but ischemic stroke incidence was similar ( 6.0 % and 6.5 % ; P = 0.69 ) .
in this trial , lowering systolic BP to < 130 mm Hg did not reduce the overall incidence of recurrent stroke .
however , when these results are pooled with results from the other large trial ( cited above ) , a small reduction in recurrent stroke ( ≈ 1.5 percentage points during 4 years ) reaches statistical significance .
I believe that a ≈ 120 mm Hg systolic BP target for patients with previous stroke is reasonable if it can be accomplished without adverse effects .
however , the incremental benefit likely is small , and whether the outcomes from Japan are applicable to other populations is unclear .
preliminary data from large prospective cohort studies are the first to show a protective effect .
recent studies show a strong association between type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .
so , could dietary interventions to prevent T2D also lead to reduction in HCC and cirrhosis risks ?
researchers addressed this question using data from the prospective Nurse 's Health Study and Health Professionals Follow @-@ Up Study .
they utilized a validated dietary diabetes risk reduction score ( range , 8 @-@ 32 ; a higher score indicates a healthier diet ) .
the score is calculated based on reported intake of foods considered favorable ( e.g. , cereal fiber , nuts ) and unfavorable ( e.g. , trans fats and red and processed meats ) to diabetes risk .
multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for the development of HCC and cirrhosis .
nearly 88,000 women and 50,000 men comprised the study cohort .
during a follow @-@ up of 32 years ( 1.9 million person @-@ years ) , 160 incident HCC cases were identified .
in multivariate analysis , the dietary diabetes risk reduction score was associated with lower risk for HCC ( adjusted hazard ratio , 0.57 for the highest vs. lowest quartile ) , as well as lower cirrhosis risk ( aHR , 0.55 for highest vs. lowest quartile ) .
as the authors note , these are the first data to show that eating a diet that promotes prevention of T2D might protect against HCC and cirrhosis .
these findings require confirmation , especially because of incomplete data regarding hepatitis B and C infection status and the small number of HCC cases .
if future studies bear out these findings , focusing on a diet that prevents diabetes - an acknowledged driver of heart disease and now liver disease - would be a practical diet for all patients .
severe caloric restriction led to more weight loss but also more bone loss .
severe energy restriction ( < 800 kcal / day ) is effective for weight loss , but known side effects ( e.g. , hair loss , fatigue ) have limited its use .
in this trial , 100 obese postmenopausal Australian women ( mean age , 58 ; mean body @-@ mass index , 34 kg / m2 ) without osteoporosis were randomized to receive either a severe or a moderate energy @-@ restricted diet .
the moderate diet cut energy intake by 25 % to 35 % relative to estimated energy expenditure using a healthy food @-@ based plan .
at 12 months , the severe @-@ diet group , compared with the moderate @-@ diet group , had lost more weight ( mean , 15.3 kg vs. 8.4 kg ) and more lean body mass ( 1.2 kg vs. 0.4 kg ) .
hip bone @-@ mineral density ( BMD ) declined more in the severe @-@ diet group than in the moderate @-@ diet group , resulting in a higher prevalence of osteopenia ( 39 % vs. 29 % ) .
more participants in the severe @-@ diet group completed the trial ( 92 % vs. 77 % ) ; no severe side effects were reported .
the clinical importance of decreased BMD associated with severe energy @-@ restricted diets is unclear .
total fracture risk was lower in active women , but knees and arms were at higher risk with more activity .
the Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) was a prospective cohort study of 77,206 postmenopausal women ( mean age at enrollment , 63 ) who underwent baseline assessments for physical and sedentary activity .
in this analysis of WHI data , researchers explored the association between physical activity and hip and total fracture risk ; participants were followed for a mean of 14 years , during which 25,516 women ( 33 % ) reported fractures .
compared with inactive women , age @-@ adjusted total relative fracture risk was significantly lower ( by 6 % -8 % ) among women with any level of physical activity .
these details of higher or lower risk for various types of fractures do not change the overall conclusion that more physical activity generally is beneficial for postmenopausal women .
however , these details do help clinicians counsel patients about potential risk associated with increasing physical activity .
but median follow @-@ up was only about 2 years in this large retrospective study .
what is the best first @-@ line treatment for patients with hypertension ?
according to current guidelines - based largely on randomized trials that are more than 2 decades old - thiazide or thiazide @-@ like diuretics , angiotensin @-@ converting @-@ enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , angiotensin @-@ receptor blockers ( ARBs ) , and calcium @-@ channel blockers ( CCBs ) are acceptable first @-@ line therapies ( NEJM JW Gen Med Dec 15 2017 and J Am Coll Cardiol 2018 ; 71 : 127 ) .
researchers analyzed data from nine large observational databases from four countries ( with data on 4.9 million patients with as long as 22 years of follow @-@ up ) and synthesized tens of thousands of between @-@ drug comparisons in patients whose initial treatment was a single drug from any of the aforementioned classes ( median patient follow @-@ up , ≈ 2 years ) .
multiple advanced statistical techniques were applied to minimize confounding .
ACE inhibitors were used most often for initial monotherapy ( 48 % of patients ) , followed by thiazide or thiazide @-@ like diuretics ( 17 % ) , dihydropyridine calcium @-@ channel blockers ( e.g. , amlodipine ; 16 % ) , angiotensin @-@ receptor blockers ( 15 % ) , and non @-@ dihydropyridine calcium @-@ channel blockers ( e.g. , diltiazem ; 3 % ) .
most comparisons showed no significant difference in incidence of the combined primary outcome ( i.e. , myocardial infarction , hospitalization for heart failure , and stroke ) between classes , but thiazides conferred a significantly lower risk for all three outcomes relative to ACE inhibitors ( hazard ratios , ≈ 0.8 for all outcomes ) , and non @-@ dihydropyridine CCBs significantly underperformed all other classes .
compared with ACE inhibitors , thiazides were associated with significantly lower rates for 16 of 46 adverse safety outcomes .
this massive data analysis , although retrospective , reveals real @-@ world outcomes on a scale far beyond any conceivable randomized trial and suggests that the most commonly prescribed drugs for initial antihypertensive treatment might not be the safest and most effective .
however , it 's possible that patterns of effectiveness and adverse effects across drug classes would change with longer duration of follow @-@ up .
olaparib has shown significant clinical benefit as maintenance therapy in women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer with a BRCA mutation .
the effect of combining maintenance olaparib and bevacizumab in patients regardless of BRCA mutation status is unknown .
we conducted a randomized , double @-@ blind , international phase 3 trial .
eligible patients had newly diagnosed , advanced , high @-@ grade ovarian cancer and were having a response after first @-@ line platinum @-@ taxane chemotherapy plus bevacizumab .
patients were eligible regardless of surgical outcome or BRCA mutation status .
patients were randomly assigned in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive olaparib tablets ( 300 mg twice daily ) or placebo for up to 24 months ; all the patients received bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks for up to 15 months in total .
the primary end point was the time from randomization until investigator @-@ assessed disease progression or death .
of the 806 patients who underwent randomization , 537 were assigned to receive olaparib and 269 to receive placebo .
after a median follow @-@ up of 22.9 months , the median progression @-@ free survival was 22.1 months with olaparib plus bevacizumab and 16.6 months with placebo plus bevacizumab ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.59 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.49 to 0.72 ; P < 0.001 ) .
the hazard ratio ( olaparib group vs. placebo group ) for disease progression or death was 0.33 ( 95 % CI , 0.25 to 0.45 ) in patients with tumors positive for homologous @-@ recombination deficiency ( HRD ) , including tumors that had BRCA mutations ( median progression @-@ free survival , 37.2 vs. 17.7 months ) , and 0.43 ( 95 % CI , 0.28 to 0.66 ) in patients with HRD @-@ positive tumors that did not have BRCA mutations ( median progression @-@ free survival , 28.1 vs. 16.6 months ) .
adverse events were consistent with the established safety profiles of olaparib and bevacizumab .
in patients with advanced ovarian cancer receiving first @-@ line standard therapy including bevacizumab , the addition of maintenance olaparib provided a significant progression @-@ free survival benefit , which was substantial in patients with HRD @-@ positive tumors , including those without a BRCA mutation . ( Funded by ARCAGY Research and others ; PAOLA @-@ 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02477644 . )
newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer is treated with curative intent .
however , owing to late diagnosis with advanced @-@ stage disease , the vast majority of patients have a relapse ( after a median of 10 to 18 months ) , 1,2 despite being treated with cytoreductive surgery and platinum @-@ based chemotherapy.3
the addition of the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab to carboplatin plus paclitaxel , followed by bevacizumab alone , is a standard option in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer.1,2,4 @-@ 7
recently , in the phase 3 SOLO1 trial , the poly ( adenosine diphosphate @-@ ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor olaparib provided a substantial progression @-@ free survival benefit as maintenance monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer whose tumors had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation ( BRCA mutation ) and who had a complete or partial clinical response after platinum @-@ based chemotherapy ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.30 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.23 to 0.41 ; P < 0.001 ) .8
PARP inhibitors trap PARP on DNA at sites of single @-@ strand breaks , preventing the repair of these breaks and generating double @-@ strand breaks that cannot be repaired accurately in tumors with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency ( HRD ) .9
HRD is not limited to tumors with BRCA mutations and is present in approximately 50 % of high @-@ grade serous ovarian tumors.10
indeed , in platinum @-@ sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer , 11 @-@ 13 PARP inhibitors are active as maintenance monotherapy in patients who have tumors without BRCA mutations , although the magnitude of benefit appears lower than in patients with BRCA @-@ mutated tumors .
moreover , the addition of an antiangiogenic agent to a PARP inhibitor in phase 2 studies involving patients with relapsed platinum @-@ sensitive ovarian cancer14 @-@ 16 resulted in longer progression @-@ free survival than the use of a PARP inhibitor alone .
in the phase 3 PAOLA @-@ 1 ( PAOLA @-@ 1 / ENGOT @-@ ov25 ) trial , we evaluated maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor ( olaparib ) as compared with placebo in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who were receiving chemotherapy plus bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab , regardless of BRCA mutation status .
patients were eligible irrespective of previous surgical outcome ( residual macroscopic disease or no residual macroscopic disease after upfront or interval surgery ) .
after first @-@ line treatment with platinum @-@ taxane chemotherapy plus bevacizumab , patients were required to have no evidence of disease or to have had a clinical complete or partial response ( definitions in Table 1 ) .
patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 ( on a 5 @-@ point scale in which higher numbers reflect greater disability ) , and a tumor sample had to be available for central testing to determine BRCA mutation status .
details of BRCA testing and full eligibility criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
the randomized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled PAOLA @-@ 1 trial was conducted in 11 countries .
randomization was performed centrally with the use of a block design with stratification according to the outcome of first @-@ line treatment at screening and tumor BRCA status ( see the Supplementary Appendix ) .
patients were assigned to olaparib tablets or matching placebo tablets with the use of an interactive Web or voice response system .
patients were randomly assigned in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive olaparib ( 300 mg twice daily ) or placebo at least 3 weeks and no more than 9 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy .
all the major toxic effects that were associated with chemotherapy had to have resolved to grade 1 ( according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] , version 4.03 ) or had to have resolved completely ( except alopecia and peripheral neuropathy ) .
administration of olaparib or placebo continued for up to 24 months from randomization or until disease progression ( according to investigators " assessment of imaging based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] , version 1.1 ) or unacceptable toxic effects , whichever occurred first , as long as the patient had a benefit and did not meet other discontinuation criteria .
crossover between the trial groups was not planned .
after discontinuation of the intervention , patients could receive other treatments at the investigators " discretion .
details of discontinuation criteria and methods for unblinding are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
as part of the intervention , intravenous bevacizumab was initiated in combination with chemotherapy and was continued after randomization as maintenance therapy at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks for a total duration of up to 15 months .
tumor assessment scans ( computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging ) were performed at baseline and then every 24 weeks ( or at planned visits every 12 weeks if there was evidence of clinical progression or progression according to the serum level of cancer antigen 125 ) up to month 42 or until the date of data cutoff .
subgroup analyses of progression @-@ free survival and a blinded independent central review of progression @-@ free survival were performed .
secondary end points were the time from randomization until second disease progression or death , overall survival , the time until the first subsequent therapy or death , and the global health status @-@ quality of life dimension of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ @-@ C30 ; scores range from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating better health @-@ related quality of life and with a minimal clinically important difference defined as 10 points ) .17
the EORTC QLQ @-@ C30 was completed at baseline and then every 12 weeks for 2 years or until the date of data cutoff .
adverse events were graded with the use of the CTCAE , version 4.03 .
tumor HRD status was determined with the use of the myChoice HRD Plus assay ( Myriad Genetic Laboratories ) .
an HRD score of 42 or higher indicated a positive test , and an HRD score of less than 42 indicated a negative test .
details of trial end points and analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
the trial was performed in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines under the auspices of an independent data monitoring committee .
the trial was designed by the European Network for Gynecological Oncological Trial Groups ( ENGOT ) lead group , Groupe d 'Investigateurs Nationaux pour l 'Etude des Cancers Ovariens , and sponsored by Association de Recherche Cancers Gynécologiques ( ARCAGY ) Research , according to the ENGOT model A ( academic sponsor ; details of this research model are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ) .18,19
ARCAGY Research was responsible for overseeing the collection , analysis , and interpretation of the data .
AstraZeneca , Merck Sharp & Dohme ( a subsidiary of Merck ) , and F. Hoffmann @-@ La Roche were given the opportunity to review drafts of the manuscripts but were not asked to approve the final content because this was an academic @-@ sponsored trial .
the authors wrote the manuscript , with medical writing assistance funded by ARCAGY Research , AstraZeneca , and Merck Sharp & Dohme .
the authors attest to the accuracy and completeness of the data and to the adherence of the trial to the protocol ( available at NEJM.org ) .
the trial was designed to detect a treatment effect ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death ) of 0.75 , translating to an improvement in median progression @-@ free survival from 15.8 months in the placebo group to 21.1 months in the olaparib group20 ; 458 primary end @-@ point events ( disease progression or death ) would give the trial more than 80 % power at a two @-@ sided significance level of 5 % to show a significant difference in progression @-@ free survival between the olaparib group and the placebo group .
the randomization of 762 patients would result in data being mature once approximately 60 % of the patients had had disease progression or had died ; an additional 24 patients underwent randomization in Japan .
all efficacy data were summarized and analyzed in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , which included all the patients who had undergone randomization , regardless of the intervention received .
in this analysis , we used the electronic case @-@ report form data set , except for the prespecified HRD analysis , which used the Myriad myChoice Plus HRD test .
safety data were summarized in the safety analysis set ( all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib or placebo ) .
analyses of health @-@ related quality of life used an imputation @-@ based approach for missing questionnaires .
the Kaplan @-@ Meier method was used to estimate progression @-@ free survival , with the stratified log @-@ rank test used to assess the difference between the olaparib group and the placebo group .
the hazard ratio and associated 95 % confidence interval were calculated with the use of a stratified Cox proportional @-@ hazards model .
in order to show consistency of the treatment effect in prespecified subgroups , a preplanned progression @-@ free survival analysis was performed in which the hazard ratio and 95 % confidence interval were calculated with the use of an unstratified Cox model .
analyses of secondary efficacy end points used a method similar to that used in the progression @-@ free survival analysis .
a hierarchical @-@ testing procedure was used to control for type I error at 5 % for progression @-@ free survival , second progression @-@ free survival , and overall survival , in that order .
the change from baseline in the global health status @-@ quality of life score was assessed with the use of a mixed model for repeated measures.21
adverse events were analyzed descriptively ; an interim safety analysis was planned and conducted .
details of the statistical analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
from July 2015 through September 2017 , a total of 806 patients underwent randomization .
the baseline characteristics were well balanced between the trial groups ( Table 1 and Tables S2 through S4 ) .
a total of 30 % of the patients had stage IV disease , and most patients had no evidence of disease owing to complete cytoreduction or were having a complete response after first @-@ line treatment .
a total of 30 % of the patients had a deleterious tumor BRCA mutation .
the primary analysis of investigator @-@ assessed progression @-@ free survival was performed after 474 of 806 patients had had disease progression or had died ( data maturity , 59 % ) ( data cutoff , March 22 , 2019 ) .
the median duration of follow @-@ up for the primary analysis was 22.7 months ( range , 18.0 to 27.7 ) in the olaparib group and 24.0 months ( range , 18.7 to 27.7 ) in the placebo group ; the median duration of follow @-@ up in the combined groups was 22.9 months .
the duration of investigator @-@ assessed progression @-@ free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group ( median , 22.1 months vs. 16.6 months ; hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.59 ; 95 % CI , 0.49 to 0.72 ; P < 0.001 ) ( Figure 1 ) .
results of subgroup analyses of progression @-@ free survival showed a benefit in the majority of predefined subgroups ( Figure 2 ) .
in patients with a tumor BRCA mutation , the median progression @-@ free survival was 37.2 months in the olaparib group and 21.7 months in the placebo group ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.31 ; 95 % CI , 0.20 to 0.47 ) ( Figure 3A ) .
in patients without a tumor BRCA mutation , the median progression @-@ free survival was 18.9 months in the olaparib group and 16.0 months in the placebo group ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.71 ; 95 % CI , 0.58 to 0.88 ) ( Figure 3B ) .
in patients with tumors positive for HRD ( tumor score of ≥ 42 on the myChoice HRD Plus assay or tumor BRCA mutation ) , the median progression @-@ free survival was 37.2 months in the olaparib group and 17.7 months in the placebo group ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.33 ; 95 % CI , 0.25 to 0.45 ) ( Figure 3C ) .
in patients with HRD @-@ positive tumors that did not have BRCA mutations , the median progression @-@ free survival was 28.1 months in the olaparib group and 16.6 months in the placebo group ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.43 ; 95 % CI , 0.28 to 0.66 ) ( Figure 3D ) .
overall survival data are immature .
the median duration of the randomized intervention was 17.3 months ( range , 0.0 to 33.0 ) for olaparib and 15.6 months ( range , 0.1 to 26.2 ) for placebo .
the median duration of treatment with bevacizumab since randomization was 11.0 months ( range , 0.7 to 21.4 ) in the olaparib group and 10.6 months ( range , 0.7 to 17.1 ) in the placebo group .
the most common adverse events and the incidence of associated grade 3 or higher adverse events for the entire maintenance treatment period are shown in Table 2 and Table S5 .
the most common adverse events ( all grades ) that occurred at a higher incidence among patients receiving olaparib plus bevacizumab than among those receiving placebo plus bevacizumab were fatigue , nausea , and anemia ( Table 2 ) .
the most common adverse event ( all grades ) that occurred at a higher incidence among patients receiving placebo plus bevacizumab than among those receiving olaparib plus bevacizumab was hypertension ( Table 2 ) .
serious adverse events occurred in 31 % of the patients in both trial groups ( Table S6 ) .
the most common serious adverse event that occurred at a higher incidence with olaparib plus bevacizumab than with placebo plus bevacizumab was anemia ( 34 patients [ 6 % ] in the olaparib group and 1 patient [ < 1 % ] in the placebo group ) .
the most common serious adverse event that occurred at a higher incidence with placebo plus bevacizumab than with olaparib plus bevacizumab was hypertension ( 35 patients [ 13 % ] in the placebo group and 48 patients [ 9 % ] in the olaparib group ) .
fatal adverse events occurred during the trial intervention or up to 30 days after discontinuation of the intervention in 1 of 535 patients ( < 1 % ) in the olaparib group and in 4 of 267 patients ( 1 % ) in the placebo group . ( details of serious and fatal adverse events are provided in the Supplementary Appendix . )
myelodysplastic syndromes , acute myeloid leukemia , or aplastic anemia occurred in 6 of 535 patients ( 1 % ) receiving olaparib plus bevacizumab and in 1 of 267 patients ( < 1 % ) receiving placebo plus bevacizumab .
new primary cancers occurred in 7 of 535 patients ( 1 % ) in the olaparib group and in 3 of 267 patients ( 1 % ) in the placebo group .
grade 1 or 2 pneumonitis , interstitial lung disease , or bronchiolitis occurred in 6 patients ( 1 % ) in the olaparib group and no patients in the placebo group .
adverse events were usually managed by dose modification rather than discontinuation ( Table 2 ) .
the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of olaparib were anemia and nausea ( Table S7 ) .
adverse events occurring only in the time period when bevacizumab was being administered as maintenance therapy are summarized in Table S8 .
adverse events of special interest for bevacizumab ( e.g. , hypertension ) are shown in Table S9 .
the mean global health status @-@ quality of life score at baseline was 68.6 in the olaparib group and 67.1 in the placebo group .
the estimated between @-@ group difference was 1.56 points ( 95 % CI , − 0.42 to 3.55 ) .
none of these changes were considered to be clinically significant .
in the phase 3 PAOLA @-@ 1 trial , we evaluated maintenance therapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib as compared with placebo in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who were receiving chemotherapy and bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab .
the trial met its primary objective by showing a significant progression @-@ free survival benefit in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
the PAOLA @-@ 1 population was representative of the majority of patients with advanced ovarian cancer because patient selection was not restricted on the basis of surgical outcome or BRCA mutation status .
prespecified subgroup analyses showed a progression @-@ free survival benefit with olaparib in patients with BRCA @-@ mutated and HRD @-@ positive tumors .
the results in patients with HRD @-@ positive tumors without a BRCA mutation ( comprising nearly 20 % of the PAOLA @-@ 1 population , which is broadly consistent with expectations ) 10 identify another patient population who had a substantial clinical benefit from olaparib .
a benefit was also seen in patients whose tumor HRD status was unknown , such as those with failed tests or insufficient tumor samples .
in this trial , the progression @-@ free survival benefit seen with olaparib plus bevacizumab in patients with BRCA @-@ mutated tumors ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.31 ; 95 % CI , 0.20 to 0.47 ) is consistent with that observed in the SOLO1 trial ( hazard ratio , 0.30 ; 95 % CI , 0.23 to 0.41 ) , 8 despite the improved outcome of the control group in our trial ( median progression @-@ free survival , 21.7 months with placebo plus bevacizumab in the PAOLA @-@ 1 trial and 13.8 months with placebo in the SOLO1 trial ) , which may be due to the addition of bevacizumab or to differences in patient selection.22
caution is needed when comparing outcomes between patients in the SOLO1 trial and patients with BRCA @-@ mutated tumors in the PAOLA @-@ 1 trial because of differences between the two trials , including in baseline characteristics ( Table S3 ) .
patients in the PAOLA @-@ 1 trial had a higher disease burden , with a lower percentage of patients undergoing upfront cytoreductive surgery ( 51 % , vs. 63 % in the SOLO1 trial ) and a higher percentage of patients having residual macroscopic disease after cytoreductive surgery ( 35 % vs. 22 % ) and stage IV disease ( 30 % vs. 17 % ) .
the lack of a maintenance olaparib monotherapy comparator group is a limitation of the PAOLA @-@ 1 trial , making it difficult to conclude whether the progression @-@ free survival benefit seen in patients with HRD @-@ positive tumors without BRCA mutations ( who were not included in the SOLO1 trial ) was due largely to the addition of olaparib or whether a synergistic effect occurred with olaparib and bevacizumab .
according to preclinical data , hypoxia that is induced by an antiangiogenic treatment can induce , or at least increase , HRD , 23 which means that bevacizumab may increase the activity of olaparib in patients with HRD @-@ positive tumors and , in particular , patients with HRD @-@ positive tumors without a BRCA mutation ; this hypothesis requires further exploration .
data regarding second progression @-@ free survival and overall survival are currently immature .
although HRD subgroup analyses were prespecified , they were not part of the multiple @-@ testing procedure for this trial .
the safety profile of the olaparib group in the PAOLA @-@ 1 trial was generally consistent with that reported for olaparib in the SOLO1 trial8 and in patients with relapsed disease ( phase 3 SOLO2 trial ) , 24 with the notable exception of hypertension , a frequent toxic effect of bevacizumab , which was more common in the PAOLA @-@ 1 trial .
the addition of olaparib to bevacizumab did not increase the known toxic effects associated with bevacizumab .
the incidence of myelodysplastic syndromes , acute myeloid leukemia , or aplastic anemia among patients with newly diagnosed disease in the PAOLA @-@ 1 trial ( 1 % in the olaparib group and < 1 % in the placebo group ) was similar to that reported in the SOLO1 trial8 and in trials involving patients with relapsed disease.12,13,24,25
greater understanding and prospective registries are needed to determine the characteristics of patients at risk for these rare , but potentially fatal , hematologic disturbances .
neither trial group had a clinically significant change in health @-@ related quality of life .
there was no evidence of a meaningful difference in health @-@ related quality of life between the trial groups .
administering maintenance olaparib in addition to bevacizumab to patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who were receiving standard treatment including bevacizumab resulted in a significant progression @-@ free survival benefit , with a substantial benefit in patients with HRD @-@ positive tumors .
previously defined toxic effects of olaparib and bevacizumab were noted , and rare serious hematologic and mild @-@ to @-@ moderate pulmonary toxic effects also occurred .
data are limited regarding the use of poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) polymerase inhibitors , such as veliparib , in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance as initial treatment in patients with high @-@ grade serous ovarian carcinoma .
in an international , phase 3 , placebo @-@ controlled trial , we assessed the efficacy of veliparib added to first @-@ line induction chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel and continued as maintenance monotherapy in patients with previously untreated stage III or IV high @-@ grade serous ovarian carcinoma .
patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to receive chemotherapy plus placebo followed by placebo maintenance ( control ) , chemotherapy plus veliparib followed by placebo maintenance ( veliparib combination only ) , or chemotherapy plus veliparib followed by veliparib maintenance ( veliparib throughout ) .
cytoreductive surgery could be performed before initiation or after 3 cycles of trial treatment .
combination chemotherapy was 6 cycles , and maintenance therapy was 30 additional cycles .
the primary end point was investigator @-@ assessed progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ throughout group as compared with the control group , analyzed sequentially in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , the cohort with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency ( HRD ) ( which included the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort ) , and the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , the median progression @-@ free survival was 34.7 months in the veliparib @-@ throughout group and 22.0 months in the control group ( hazard ratio for progression or death , 0.44 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.28 to 0.68 ; P < 0.001 ) ; in the HRD cohort , it was 31.9 months and 20.5 months , respectively ( hazard ratio , 0.57 ; 95 CI , 0.43 to 0.76 ; P < 0.001 ) ; and in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , it was 23.5 months and 17.3 months ( hazard ratio , 0.68 ; 95 % CI , 0.56 to 0.83 ; P < 0.001 ) .
veliparib led to a higher incidence of anemia and thrombocytopenia when combined with chemotherapy as well as of nausea and fatigue overall .
across all trial populations , a regimen of carboplatin , paclitaxel , and veliparib induction therapy followed by veliparib maintenance therapy led to significantly longer progression @-@ free survival than carboplatin plus paclitaxel induction therapy alone .
the independent value of adding veliparib during induction therapy without veliparib maintenance was less clear . ( Funded by AbbVie ; VELIA / GOG @-@ 3005 ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02470585 . )
since the introduction of paclitaxel in 1996,1 efforts to augment the efficacy of treatment in patients with advanced @-@ stage ovarian cancer have yielded limited success .
the introductions of weekly paclitaxel therapy , intraperitoneal chemotherapy , and bevacizumab therapy are recognized alterations that are considered to be acceptable as primary therapy.2 @-@ 5
delayed cytoreductive surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also become increasingly popular , given the evidence of noninferiority to primary debulking surgery that has been shown in randomized , controlled trials.6 @-@ 8
nevertheless , progressive disease develops in more than 75 % of patients within 3 years.9
new agents and approaches are needed .
poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitors have efficacy as single agents in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer and as maintenance therapy after patients have had a response to platinum @-@ based therapy.10 @-@ 18
olaparib , 12,15 rucaparib , 14,16 and niraparib13 have been approved for indications in high @-@ grade epithelial ovarian cancer , but only olaparib has been approved as maintenance therapy in patients with deleterious BRCA mutations after a response to first @-@ line chemotherapy.17
combining PARP inhibitors with chemotherapy has been challenging because of hematologic toxic effects that result in substantial dose reductions.19
veliparib is an oral PARP inhibitor20 that has shown activity as a single agent in early @-@ phase trials and that can be combined with standard chemotherapy doses.21 @-@ 24
approximately 20 % of ovarian carcinomas have germline ( 15 % ) or somatic ( 5 % ) BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations , 25 and up to 30 % more have genomic alterations resulting in homologous @-@ recombination deficiency ( HRD ) .26
these alterations increase tumor susceptibility to agents including platinum and PARP inhibitors.25 @-@ 29
we hypothesized that veliparib added to platinum @-@ based chemotherapy and continued as maintenance therapy would prolong progression @-@ free survival .
here , we report results from VELIA / GOG @-@ 3005 , a randomized , placebo @-@ controlled trial of veliparib in patients with newly diagnosed , high @-@ grade serous ovarian carcinoma .
women at least 18 years of age who had received an initial histologic diagnosis of high @-@ grade serous epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , or primary peritoneal carcinoma of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III or IV were included in the trial ( Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org ) .30
additional eligibility criteria are listed in the protocol ( available at NEJM.org ) .
the submission of blood and tumor @-@ tissue samples for central assessment of germline BRCA , tissue @-@ based ( included somatic ) BRCA , and homologous @-@ recombination status was required .
the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort was defined as patients who had deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or tissue @-@ based mutations , as determined by the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx or myChoice HRD CDx assay , respectively , in BRCA1 or BRCA2 .
the cohort of patients with tumors that had HRD consisted of patients who had tumors that were BRCA @-@ mutated or had HRD according to the myChoice assay ( on which a score of ≥ 33 was considered to indicate HRD status , and a score of < 33 was considered to indicate non @-@ HRD status ; the threshold score was revised from 42 , after several retrospective analyses of previous clinical trials , to increase the sensitivity of detecting a response to PARP inhibitors ) .31 @-@ 33
the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population comprised all the patients who had undergone randomization .
for exploratory analyses , the cohort of patients with nonmutated BRCA status consisted of patients with known BRCA status and no germline or tissue @-@ based BRCA mutations .
patients whose tumors had non @-@ HRD status had no genetic evidence of HRD .
this phase 3 , double @-@ blind trial was conducted at 202 sites in 10 countries .
randomization in the entire population was stratified according to the timing of surgery and residual disease after primary surgery , the paclitaxel schedule , stage of disease , geographic region , and germline BRCA status as described in the protocol .
cytoreductive surgery could be performed before the initiation of trial treatment ( primary ) or after three cycles of trial treatment ( interval ) .
the weekly or every @-@ 3 @-@ week paclitaxel schedule and the choice of primary or interval cytoreductive surgery were determined at the discretion of the investigator .
the germline BRCA status was added as a stratification factor after 655 patients ( 57 % ) had enrolled in order to counteract an imbalance regarding BRCA @-@ mutation status that was noted by the independent data and safety monitoring committee .
each trial regimen consisted of 36 cycles lasting 21 days each , including 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 30 cycles of maintenance therapy .
chemotherapy consisted of carboplatin ( given at an area under the curve [ AUC ] of 6 mg per milliliter per minute , every 3 weeks ) and paclitaxel ( 175 mg per square meter of body @-@ surface area , administered every 3 weeks , or 80 mg per square meter , administered weekly ) .
patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to one of the following three groups : the control group ( in which patients received chemotherapy plus placebo followed by placebo maintenance ) ; the veliparib @-@ combination @-@ only group ( in which patients received chemotherapy plus veliparib followed by placebo maintenance ) ; or the veliparib @-@ throughout group ( in which patients received chemotherapy plus veliparib followed by veliparib maintenance ) .
during chemotherapy , patients received veliparib at a dose of 150 mg orally or matching placebo twice daily.24
patients who completed chemotherapy without disease progression received single @-@ agent veliparib at a dose of 300 mg or matching placebo twice daily for 2 weeks ( transition period ) and then veliparib at a dose of 400 mg or matching placebo twice daily if the dose in the transition period was not associated with limiting side effects .
the primary end point was investigator @-@ assessed progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ throughout group as compared with the control group , analyzed sequentially in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , the HRD cohort , and the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
secondary end points were overall survival in the veliparib @-@ throughout group as compared with the control group , progression @-@ free survival and overall survival in the veliparib @-@ combination @-@ only group as compared with the control group , and the Disease Related Symptom score ( see below ) in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , the HRD cohort , and the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
tumor assessments according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , version 1.1 , occurred at baseline and at protocol @-@ defined intervals until the occurrence of imaging @-@ based progression as assessed by the investigator.34
patients undergoing interval surgery had a tumor baseline reassessment after surgery .
after the occurrence of investigator @-@ assessed progression , data on survival , subsequent therapy , and new @-@ onset cancer were collected until death or loss to follow @-@ up .
investigators could be made aware of the assigned treatment after the occurrence of disease progression .
crossover to veliparib was not allowed in the trial .
the Disease Related Symptom score is a subset of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Ovarian Symptom Index @-@ 18 ( NFOSI @-@ 18 ) , which evaluates nine symptoms related to disease or treatment.35
this questionnaire was administered at protocol @-@ defined intervals until disease progression or up to 2 years after the receipt of the first dose , whichever was later .
scores range from 0 to 36 , with higher scores indicating a lower burden of symptoms .
a 3 @-@ point difference was defined as clinically meaningful.36
adverse events were categorized according to preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities , version 21.1 , and were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , version 4.03 .
the trial protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at the investigational sites ; the statistical analysis plan and all amendments are provided with the protocol .
the trial was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines , regulations governing clinical study conduct , and ethical principles with their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki .
the trial was designed and conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group and the sponsor ( AbbVie ) .
an independent data and safety monitoring committee reviewed unblinded safety data and provided recommendations for continuation or termination .
all the authors had access to the data and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol .
the manuscript was written by the authors , with medical writing assistance funded by the sponsor .
representatives of the sponsor also participated in the trial conduct , the analysis and interpretation of the data , and the writing and review of the manuscript .
the authors and sponsor made the decision to submit the manuscript for submission for publication .
efficacy analyses were performed in three sequentially inclusive populations : the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , the HRD cohort ( which included the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort ) , and the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
all the patients who had received at least one dose of veliparib or placebo were included in the safety analyses .
the data @-@ cutoff date for the primary analysis was May 3 , 2019 .
the trial sought to enroll 1100 patients and was powered to test progression @-@ free survival and overall survival in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population and the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort .
on the basis of emerging efficacy data regarding patients with HRD tumors , 13,14,16,37 the protocol was amended to add testing variables for the primary and secondary end points within this cohort .
the database lock occurred when the protocol @-@ specified number of progression @-@ free survival events in the control group plus the veliparib @-@ throughout group was confirmed on independent analysis of the statistical data .
a two @-@ sided P value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statistical significance in analyses that followed a hierarchical testing sequence .
specifically , progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ throughout group and the control group was first compared in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , then in the HRD cohort , and then in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
this analysis was to be followed by an evaluation of overall survival ( once a sufficient number of events had accrued ) in the veliparib @-@ throughout group and the control group in each of the three populations .
the testing sequence was to end at the first test that did not meet the threshold for significance .
progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ combination @-@ only group as compared with the control group would be formally tested if the comparisons for overall survival met the threshold for significance .
distributions of progression @-@ free survival and overall survival in each group were estimated with the use of the Kaplan @-@ Meier method .
progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ throughout group or the veliparib @-@ combination @-@ only group was compared with the control group by a log @-@ rank test , stratified according to residual disease status and disease stage in all the trial populations , as well as according to choice of the paclitaxel regimen and BRCA @-@ mutation status in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
hazard ratios in the analyses of progression @-@ free survival and overall survival were estimated by means of a Cox model stratified according to the same factors as those used in the log @-@ rank test .
the mean change from baseline in the Disease Related Symptom scores was compared with the use of a mixed @-@ model , repeated @-@ measures method .
from July 2015 through July 2017 , a total of 1140 patients underwent randomization .
BRCA @-@ mutation and homologous @-@ recombination status was determined in 91 % and 88 % of the patients , respectively .
a total of 298 patients ( 26 % ) were included in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort ( 214 patients [ 19 % ] had a germline BRCA mutation , and 84 [ 7 % ] had a tissue @-@ based BRCA mutation ) , and 627 patients ( 55 % ) were included in the HRD cohort ( 298 patients [ 26 % ] had tumors that had HRD and were BRCA @-@ mutated , and 329 patients [ 29 % ] had tumors that had HRD with nonmutated BRCA ) .
a total of 1124 patients received at least one dose of trial therapy ( Figure 1 ) .
key demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 .
the characteristics of the patients in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort and the HRD cohort are shown in Tables S2 and S3 , respectively .
primary End Point of Progression @-@ free Survival
at the time of the database lock , the median duration of follow @-@ up was 28 months .
the primary efficacy end point of progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ throughout group as compared with the control group was significantly prolonged in all three cohorts ( presented here in order of testing hierarchy ) .
the median progression @-@ free survival in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort was 34.7 months in the veliparib @-@ throughout group and 22.0 months in the control group ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.44 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.28 to 0.68 ; P < 0.001 ) ; in the HRD cohort , the corresponding duration was 31.9 months and 20.5 months ( hazard ratio , 0.57 ; 95 % CI , 0.43 to 0.76 ; P < 0.001 ) ; and in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , the corresponding duration was 23.5 months and 17.3 months ( hazard ratio , 0.68 ; 95 % CI , 0.56 to 0.83 ; P < 0.001 ) ( Figure 2 ) .
the number of events of disease progression or deaths and the estimates of progression @-@ free survival at 4.5 months after randomization ( approximate end of the combination phase ) are provided for each of the trial cohorts in Figure S1 and Table S4 , respectively .
at the time of this report , the data regarding overall survival were not sufficiently mature in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , the HRD cohort , and the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , with percentages of required end points of 21 % , 24 % , and 49 % , respectively .
because of the testing hierarchy , overall survival in the veliparib @-@ throughout group as compared with the control group cannot be tested until a sufficient number of events have occurred , so formal hypothesis testing of progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ combination @-@ only group as compared with the control group has not been performed .
at the time of the database lock , the median progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ combination @-@ only group and control group in the three populations was as follows .
exploratory Analyses
analyses of progression @-@ free survival in subgroups that were defined according to potential prognostic factors is shown in Figure 3 .
the findings of these analyses were directionally consistent with those of the primary analysis in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
the lack of data maturity regarding events of progression or death with a second therapy precludes a meaningful analysis at this time , with 42 % or less of the patients in any population having reported progression while receiving a second therapy .
in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , 191 patients ( 98 in the veliparib @-@ throughout group and 93 in the control group ) had measurable residual disease after primary debulking surgery from which the percentage of patients with an objective response could be assessed after six cycles of chemotherapy .
in this exploratory analysis , 84 % of the patients in the veliparib @-@ throughout group had a response , as compared with 74 % of those in the control group ( Table S5 ) .
the relative dose intensities of carboplatin and paclitaxel were similar across treatment groups and all the cohorts ( the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , the HRD cohort , and the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population ) .
in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , the veliparib @-@ throughout group and the control group received 84 % and 91 % , respectively , of the planned carboplatin doses ; 84 % and 90 % of the planned weekly doses of paclitaxel ; and 92 % and 98 % of the planned every @-@ 3 @-@ week doses of paclitaxel .
the median numbers of cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel were the same across all the groups and all the cohorts .
details are provided in Table S6 .
in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , the proportion of patients who had an adverse event during treatment ( i.e. , events reported during trial treatment or within 30 days after the discontinuation of veliparib or placebo ) were similar in the veliparib @-@ throughout group and the control group .
however , a higher percentage of patients in the veliparib @-@ throughout group than in the control group had thrombocytopenia ( Table 2 ) .
the most common adverse event during treatment that was reported in the veliparib @-@ throughout group was nausea ( in 80 % of the patients in this group ) , with most events ( 90 % ) being of grade 1 or 2 .
one event of myelodysplastic syndrome was reported in the veliparib @-@ combination @-@ only group , and one event of acute myeloid leukemia was reported in the veliparib @-@ throughout group .
the patient with myelodysplastic syndrome had a germline BRCA1 mutation .
the numbers and proportions of patients in whom adverse events during treatment were reported in the combination phase or in the maintenance phase are shown in Tables S7 and S8 , respectively .
the percentages of patients who had a reduction in the dose of veliparib or placebo or an interruption because of an adverse event were higher in the veliparib @-@ throughout group than in the control group during the combination phase ( dose reductions in 6 % and 2 % of the patients , respectively , and interruptions in 58 % and 39 % ) and the maintenance phase ( dose reductions in 24 % and 4 % , respectively , and interruptions in 41 % and 19 % ) ( Table S9 ) .
in the combination phase , 11 % or less of the patients had an adverse event leading to the discontinuation of veliparib or placebo in any group ( Table S10 ) .
in the maintenance phase , the percentage of patients who discontinued veliparib or placebo owing to an adverse event was 19 % in the veliparib @-@ throughout group and 6 % in the control group .
the most common adverse event leading to the discontinuation of veliparib therapy was nausea ( in 8 % of patients ) .
health @-@ RELATED QUALITY @-@ OF @-@ LIFE ASSESSMENTS
a total of 86 % of the patients had greater than 90 % adherence to the completion of patient @-@ reported outcome instruments during trial therapy ; 60 % of the patients had greater than 80 % adherence after therapy discontinuation .
adherence was balanced among the groups .
in the BRCA @-@ mutation cohort , the HRD cohort , and the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , the mean change from baseline in the NFOSI @-@ 18 Disease Related Symptom scores increased over time ( indicating improvement ) , particularly after chemotherapy was completed ( cycle 7 and beyond ) .
this phase 3 trial shows significantly longer progression @-@ free survival with veliparib added to standard first @-@ line chemotherapy and continued as maintenance therapy than with chemotherapy alone among patients with advanced @-@ stage , high @-@ grade serous ovarian carcinoma .
veliparib added to chemotherapy led to a higher incidence of anemia and thrombocytopenia and was generally associated with nausea and fatigue but did not adversely affect patients " quality of life as reported on surveys .
the prolongation of progression @-@ free survival was seen across a broad population of patients , including those with and those without disease that was amenable to a primary surgical cytoreduction attempt and those with and those without an identifiable tumor feature that has been associated with PARP inhibitor activity .
a response to chemotherapy was not needed for inclusion in this trial , and progression @-@ free survival was measured from randomization ( start of chemotherapy ) , in contrast to previous and contemporaneous trials of a PARP inhibitor used only as maintenance therapy ( PRIMA and PAOLA @-@ 1 ; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers , NCT02655016and NCT02477644 , respectively ) .17,38,39
an important consideration in treatment planning for primary chemotherapy is whether biomarker status is required for the selection of treatment .
we enrolled patients without regard to biomarker status and evaluated veliparib in two cohorts that were defined according to the presence of germline or tissue @-@ based BRCA mutations and HRD status , as well as in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population .
results reported by Moore et al.17 had established the safety and efficacy of PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy in patients with ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations , and the current trial shows that the benefit of a PARP inhibitor can be safely extended to all patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer .
few studies have combined PARP inhibitors with standard chemotherapy doses for the treatment of ovarian cancer.22,40
combining the two classes of agents has a strong rationale on the basis of chemotherapy @-@ induced DNA damage augmenting cellular reliance on DNA repair and improving the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor .
in a large trial , olaparib was combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy in women with recurrent , platinum @-@ sensitive ovarian cancer.19
however , the carboplatin dose was reduced to an AUC of 4 mg per milliliter per minute , and olaparib was administered at a dose of 200 mg ( in capsules ) twice daily for 10 days of a 21 @-@ day cycle ( dose intensity , 24 % ) .
in the current trial , veliparib was administered continuously during chemotherapy at a dose of 150 mg twice daily ( dose intensity , 37.5 % ) with standard doses of carboplatin ( AUC , 6 mg per milliliter per minute ) .
patients receiving veliparib were still able to receive a high proportion ( 84 to 93 % ) of all planned chemotherapy doses .
adverse events that were reported with veliparib were predominantly gastrointestinal and hematologic .
veliparib added to chemotherapy led to higher incidences of anemia and thrombocytopenia than were observed with chemotherapy alone , although the incidences were significantly lower during the maintenance phase , in which less than 8 % of the patients in the veliparib @-@ throughout group had a grade 3 or 4 event .
in general , the incidence of toxic effects with veliparib monotherapy was lower than has been reported with other PARP inhibitors.13,15 @-@ 17
this trial was designed before the safety and efficacy of PARP inhibitors in the context of maintenance therapy had been established .
at the time , we hypothesized that concurrent application of agents with effects on DNA damage response in patients who had not received chemotherapy previously would improve clinical outcomes .
results from GOG @-@ 9923 , a phase 1 trial that evaluated veliparib with six regimens of platinum @-@ based chemotherapy and bevacizumab , confirmed that veliparib could be safely administered with standard doses of chemotherapy.24
we designed this phase 3 trial to test the hypothesis that concurrent therapy with veliparib , with or without veliparib maintenance therapy , could improve progression @-@ free survival among patients with advanced ovarian cancer .
the trial design did not include a " veliparib maintenance @-@ only " group and therefore did not prospectively address the relative contribution of maintenance therapy with veliparib .
inferences drawn from the absence of improvement in progression @-@ free survival in the veliparib @-@ combination @-@ only group may suggest that the benefit from veliparib is related to its use as maintenance therapy .
if the trial had incorporated a maintenance @-@ only group and shown results similar to those seen in the veliparib @-@ throughout group , the relative contributions of concurrent and maintenance veliparib therapy in the veliparib @-@ throughout group might have been more definitively assessed .
nonetheless , other historically successful strategies that incorporated concurrent and maintenance therapy into the context of first @-@ line therapy ( i.e. , antiangiogenesis agents ) 4,5,41 have shown little difference in progression @-@ free survival during the brief exposure before maintenance treatment .
in the current trial , less than 4 % of the progression events occurred before the maintenance phase , which indicates that this measure lacks sensitivity in the context of highly active chemotherapy .
as such , the hypothesis regarding concurrent therapy remains unproved .
in this phase 3 , randomized , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial involving patients with previously untreated advanced @-@ stage ovarian cancer , veliparib that was administered concomitantly with chemotherapy and continued as maintenance therapy led to a moderately higher incidence of myelotoxic and gastrointestinal toxic effects and resulted in significantly longer progression @-@ free survival than induction chemotherapy without veliparib maintenance therapy .
niraparib , an inhibitor of poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) , has been associated with significantly increased progression @-@ free survival among patients with recurrent ovarian cancer after platinum @-@ based chemotherapy , regardless of the presence or absence of BRCA mutations .
the efficacy of niraparib in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer after a response to first @-@ line platinum @-@ based chemotherapy is unknown .
in this randomized , double @-@ blind , phase 3 trial , we randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive niraparib or placebo once daily after a response to platinum @-@ based chemotherapy .
the primary end point was progression @-@ free survival in patients who had tumors with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency and in those in the overall population , as determined on hierarchical testing .
a prespecified interim analysis for overall survival was conducted at the time of the primary analysis of progression @-@ free survival .
of the 733 patients who underwent randomization , 373 ( 50.9 % ) had tumors with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency .
among the patients in this category , the median progression @-@ free survival was significantly longer in the niraparib group than in the placebo group ( 21.9 months vs. 10.4 months ; hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.43 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.31 to 0.59 ; P < 0.001 ) .
in the overall population , the corresponding progression @-@ free survival was 13.8 months and 8.2 months ( hazard ratio , 0.62 ; 95 % CI , 0.50 to 0.76 ; P < 0.001 ) .
at the 24 @-@ month interim analysis , the rate of overall survival was 84 % in the niraparib group and 77 % in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.70 ; 95 % CI , 0.44 to 1.11 ) .
the most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were anemia ( in 31.0 % of the patients ) , thrombocytopenia ( in 28.7 % ) , and neutropenia ( in 12.8 % ) .
no treatment @-@ related deaths occurred .
among patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who had a response to platinum @-@ based chemotherapy , those who received niraparib had significantly longer progression @-@ free survival than those who received placebo , regardless of the presence or absence of homologous @-@ recombination deficiency . ( Funded by GlaxoSmithKline ; PRIMA / ENGOT @-@ OV26 / GOG @-@ 3012 ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02655016 . )
ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death from gynecologic cancers in women worldwide.1
the standard treatment for newly diagnosed advanced epithelial ovarian cancer is surgical cytoreduction and systemic platinum @-@ taxane combination chemotherapy .
unfortunately , up to 85 % of the patients with advanced ovarian cancer have a disease recurrence after completing chemotherapy .
in these patients , bevacizumab can be added to chemotherapy , followed by bevacizumab maintenance therapy .
however , the use of bevacizumab is limited because of safety concerns , and data are lacking on its use in the growing number of patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.2,3
olaparib , an inhibitor of poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) ( PARP ) , has been associated with longer progression @-@ free survival than placebo among patients with BRCA @-@ mutated tumors , which includes approximately 15 to 20 % of the patients with ovarian cancer , after a response to first @-@ line platinum @-@ based chemotherapy.4
therefore , most patients with advanced ovarian cancer do not have an effective treatment option to substantially reduce the risk of death or progressive disease after first @-@ line chemotherapy.5,6
niraparib is an oral , highly selective PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor that has been approved as maintenance therapy in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have had a response to platinum @-@ based chemotherapy .
niraparib has shown efficacy both in patients who have tumors with BRCA mutations and in those without BRCA mutations.7,8
in the NOVA ( ENGOT @-@ OV16 / NOVA ) trial , 7 patients who received niraparib had significantly longer progression @-@ free survival than those who received placebo in all the cohorts , including in patients with germline BRCA mutations ( 21.0 months vs. 5.5 months ; hazard ratio , 0.27 ; P < 0.001 ) and in those without germline BRCA mutations ( 9.3 months vs. 3.9 months ; hazard ratio , 0.45 ; P < 0.001 ) .
eligible patients were at least 18 years of age and had newly diagnosed , histologically confirmed advanced cancer of the ovary , peritoneum , or fallopian tube ( collectively defined as ovarian cancer ) .
all the patients had high @-@ grade serous or endometrioid tumors that were classified as stage III or IV , according to the criteria of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics .
included in this category were patients with stage III disease with visible residual tumor after primary debulking surgery , inoperable stage III disease , or any stage IV disease , as well as those who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
before enrollment , all the patients had received six to nine cycles of first @-@ line platinum @-@ based chemotherapy , which had resulted in a complete or partial response , according to investigator assessment .
tumor samples underwent central testing to identify those with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency ( myChoice test , Myriad Genetics ) .
homologous @-@ recombination deficiency was defined as the presence of a BRCA deleterious mutation , a score of at least 42 on the myChoice test , 9 @-@ 11 or both .
test scores ( which range from 1 to 100 , with higher scores indicating a greater number of genomic abnormalities ) represent a continuum on the basis of loss of heterozygosity , telomeric allelic imbalance , and large @-@ scale state transitions .
additional details regarding testing for homologous @-@ recombination deficiency are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org .
patients in whom status regarding homologous @-@ recombination deficiency was not determined were eligible to participate in the trial and were included in the overall population .
further details and eligibility criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
the trial was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki , Good Clinical Practices , and all local laws under the auspices of an independent data and safety monitoring committee .
the trial was designed by the sponsor , GlaxoSmithKline , in collaboration with the European Network for Gynecological Oncological Trial ( ENGOT ) groups and the cooperative group leadership of GOG Partners ( a component of the Gynecologic Oncology Group Foundation ) , according to the ENGOT model C.12
the sponsor was responsible for overseeing the collection , analysis , and interpretation of the data .
all the authors had full access to the trial data .
the authors wrote the manuscript , with medical writing assistance funded by the sponsor .
all the authors attest to the accuracy and completeness of the data and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , available at NEJM.org .
in the initial protocol , all the patients started at a fixed dose of 300 mg once daily .
the trial was amended on November 27 , 2017 , to incorporate an individualized starting dose of 200 mg once daily for patients with a baseline body weight of less than 77 kg , a platelet count of less than 150,000 per cubic millimeter , or both.13
randomization was performed in a double @-@ blind manner with the use of an interactive Web @-@ response system , with stratification according to clinical response after first @-@ line platinum @-@ based chemotherapy ( complete or partial response ) , receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( yes or no ) , and status regarding tumor homologous recombination ( deficient vs. proficient or not determined ) .
niraparib or placebo was administered continuously until the objective identification of disease progression on imaging , provided that the patient was receiving benefit and did not meet any other criteria for discontinuation , as defined in the protocol .
we performed computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to assess progressive disease every 12 weeks until treatment discontinuation .
we administered the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy @-@ Ovarian Symptom Index ( FOSI ) , 15 the European Quality of Life five @-@ dimension , five @-@ level questionnaire ( EQ @-@ 5D @-@ 5L ) , 16 the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire ( EORTC @-@ QLQ @-@ C30 ) , 17 and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Ovarian Cancer module ( EORTC @-@ QLQ @-@ OV28 ) 18 at the screening visit , throughout treatment , and 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 weeks after the last dose of niraparib or placebo . ( details regarding the trial assessments , including monitoring of adverse events , are provided in the Supplementary Appendix . )
the primary end point was progression @-@ free survival in patients who had tumors with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency and in those in the overall population , as determined on hierarchical testing .
this end point was evaluated in a time @-@ to @-@ event analysis and was assessed by blinded independent central review .
progression @-@ free survival was defined as the time from randomization after completion of platinum @-@ based chemotherapy to the earliest date of objective disease progression on imaging ( according to RECIST , version 1.1 ) or death from any cause .
an independent radiologic review and central clinician review that were conducted in a blinded manner were used to define the date of disease progression , and an identical schedule of assessments was used for the two trial groups .
overall survival was a key secondary end point .
other secondary end points were the time until the first subsequent therapy , progression @-@ free survival 2 ( defined as time from randomization to progression while the patient was receiving a subsequent anticancer therapy ) , pharmacokinetic analyses , and patient @-@ reported outcomes ( scores on the FOSI , EQ @-@ 5D @-@ 5L , and EORTC @-@ QLQ @-@ C30 / OV28 instruments ) .
safety was assessed through the monitoring of adverse events , laboratory testing , measurement of vital signs , and physical examination .
a hierarchical @-@ testing method was performed for the primary end point in the population with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency , followed by a test in the overall population .
at the time of the trial design , consideration of the reported median duration of progression @-@ free survival for patients with ovarian cancer with a BRCA mutation who received placebo led to an estimated median duration of progression @-@ free survival of 21 months in the patients with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency and 14 months in the overall population for the sample @-@ size estimation .
additional details regarding the statistical analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
from July 2016 through June 2018 , a total of 733 patients underwent randomization .
five patients who did not receive either niraparib or placebo after randomization were excluded from the safety analysis .
as of the data cutoff on May 17 , 2019 , a total of 246 patients were still receiving treatment with niraparib or placebo ( Figure 1 ) .
the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were balanced in the two trial groups ( Table 1 ) .
the overall population included patients at high risk for progressive disease as a result of stage III ovarian cancer with residual disease after primary debulking surgery ( 23.1 % ) , receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( 66.7 % ) , stage IV ovarian cancer ( 35.0 % ) , or a partial response to first @-@ line platinum @-@ based chemotherapy ( 30.5 % ) .
the primary efficacy analysis was performed after disease progression or death had occurred in 154 patients with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency and in 386 patients in the overall population .
the median duration of follow @-@ up at the time of the data cutoff was 13.8 months ( range , < 1.0 to 28.0 ) .
the median relative dose intensity ( the proportion of administered doses relative to planned doses ) was 63 % for niraparib and 99 % for placebo .
the median duration of progression @-@ free survival in patients with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency was 21.9 months with niraparib and 10.4 months with placebo ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.43 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.31 to 0.59 ; P < 0.001 ) ( Figure 2A ) .
in the overall population , the median duration of progression @-@ free survival was 13.8 months with niraparib and 8.2 months with placebo ( hazard ratio , 0.62 ; 95 % CI , 0.50 to 0.76 ; P < 0.001 ) ( Figure 2B ) .
in the interim analysis of the key secondary end point of overall survival ( performed after the deaths of 79 of 733 patients [ 10.8 % ] in the overall population ) , the estimated Kaplan @-@ Meier probability of survival at 24 months was 84 % in the niraparib group and 77 % in the placebo group ( hazard ratio for death , 0.70 ; 95 % CI , 0.44 to 1.11 ) .
in the population with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency , the interim analysis showed an estimated probability of 24 @-@ month survival of 91 % in the niraparib group and 85 % in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.61 ; 95 % CI , 0.27 to 1.39 ) .
additional details regarding the secondary end points are provided in Table S5 .
the results of prespecified exploratory analyses are provided in Figure 3 and Table S6 .
within the population with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency , the median duration of progression @-@ free survival was 22.1 months in the niraparib group and 10.9 months in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.27 to 0.62 ) in the subgroup with BRCA mutations and 19.6 months and 8.2 months , respectively ( hazard ratio , 0.50 ; 95 % CI , 0.31 to 0.83 ) , in the subgroup without BRCA mutations .
in the subgroup of patients with homologous @-@ recombination proficiency , the median duration of progression @-@ free survival was 8.1 months in the niraparib group and 5.4 months in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.68 ; 95 % CI , 0.49 to 0.94 ) .
in this population , the interim overall survival analysis showed an estimated probability of survival at 24 months of 81 % in the niraparib group and 59 % in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.51 ; 95 % CI , 0.27 to 0.97 ) .
in addition to the subgroup of patients who had tumors with homologous @-@ recombination proficiency , the treatment effect of niraparib extended to patients with advanced ovarian cancer in other subgroups with a poor prognosis , including in those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( 13.9 vs. 8.2 months ; hazard ratio , 0.59 ; 95 % CI , 0.46 to 0.76 ) and in those with a partial response to platinum @-@ based chemotherapy ( 8.3 vs. 5.6 months ; hazard ratio , 0.60 ; 95 % CI , 0.43 to 0.85 ) .
niraparib was also associated with a longer duration of progression @-@ free survival than placebo in the patients who had a complete response to chemotherapy ( 16.4 months vs. 9.5 months ; hazard ratio , 0.60 ; 95 % CI , 0.46 to 0.77 ) .
the results of a sensitivity analysis of progression @-@ free survival were similar to and supported the blinded analysis on independent central review ( Table S7 ) .
common adverse events that occurred during the trial are listed in Table 2 and Table S9 .
among the most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the niraparib group were anemia ( in 31.0 % of the patients ) , thrombocytopenia ( in 28.7 % ) , and neutropenia ( in 12.8 % ) .
dose reductions were conducted in 70.9 % of the patients in the niraparib group .
the frequency of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 12.0 % in the niraparib group and 2.5 % in the placebo group .
myelosuppressive adverse events were the main reason for discontinuation but were infrequent ( 4.3 % for thrombocytopenia in the niraparib group ) ( Table S8 ) .
one case of myelodysplastic syndrome was identified in a patient in the niraparib group .
low @-@ grade nausea and fatigue were common in the two groups .
no deaths during treatment with niraparib were reported during the trial .
safety improved with the implementation of the individualized dosing regimen ( Tables S10 and S11 ) .
survey completion rates were high and were similar in the two groups ( Table S12 ) .
in the PRIMA trial , we found that patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer who received niraparib after having a response to first @-@ line platinum @-@ based chemotherapy had significantly longer progression @-@ free survival than those who received placebo in the overall population .
no new safety signals were identified for niraparib .
historically , clinical activity with PARP inhibitors has been associated with the presence of BRCA mutations , with most studies conducted in this selected patient population .
recent nonclinical studies , 21 together with the NOVA7 and QUADRA8 clinical trials , have shown the effectiveness of niraparib in treating patients with wild @-@ type BRCA tumors .
in the PRIMA trial , our primary hypothesis was that the clinical benefit of first @-@ line treatment with niraparib could be extended to all patients with advanced ovarian cancer , including those who had tumors with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency ( with either mutated or unmutated BRCA ) and those with homologous @-@ recombination proficiency .
results of this trial confirm the hypothesis that treatment with niraparib provides a longer duration of progression @-@ free survival than placebo in the overall population .
currently , the most common treatment strategy with these patients is active surveillance .
preliminary results of the interim analysis suggest that overall survival may also be improved , but the data are not sufficiently mature to assess this end point with precision .
the high @-@ risk patients with advanced ovarian cancer who were included in this trial are generally considered to have incurable disease with chemotherapy alone .
niraparib extends treatment beyond chemotherapy and provides a sustained progression @-@ free survival benefit for those at risk for early relapse , including the one third of patients who had a partial response to platinum @-@ based chemotherapy ( 8.3 months vs. 5.6 months with placebo ; hazard ratio , 0.60 ) .
niraparib also prolonged the time without progression or death in the patients who had a complete response after chemotherapy ( 16.4 months vs. 9.5 months ; hazard ratio , 0.60 ) .
notably , at 18 months after randomization and 2 years after the diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer , Kaplan @-@ Meier analysis estimated that in the niraparib group , 59 % of the patients who had tumors with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency and 42 % of the overall population were alive without disease progression , as compared with 35 % and 28 % of patients , respectively , in the placebo group .
this treatment effect occurred without a decrement in quality of life , as assessed by patient @-@ reported outcomes .
the clinical benefit of niraparib in the overall population was not driven only by the subgroup of patients with BRCA mutations .
in the patients who had tumors with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency , niraparib provided a significant clinical benefit over placebo with respect to the median duration of progression @-@ free survival both in patients with BRCA mutations ( 22.1 months vs. 10.9 months ; hazard ratio , 0.40 ) and in those without BRCA mutations ( 19.6 months vs. 8.2 months ; hazard ratio , 0.50 ) .
in the subgroup of patients with homologous @-@ recombination proficiency , the longer median duration of progression @-@ free survival in the niraparib group than in the placebo group ( 8.1 months vs. 5.4 months ; hazard ratio , 0.68 ) supports the hypothesis that niraparib has mechanisms of action other than those involved in the repair of DNA damage .
complementary mechanisms of action for niraparib , including PARP @-@ regulated gene transcription , ribosome biogenesis , and immune activation , may explain this clinical observation.21,22
these analyses suggest that treatment with niraparib after first @-@ line platinum @-@ based chemotherapy extends benefit to all patients .
the sensitivity to niraparib is lower in patients who have tumors with homologous @-@ recombination proficiency than in those who have tumors with homologous @-@ recombination deficiency .
the use of olaparib as a first @-@ line treatment is limited to patients with BRCA mutations , as it was assessed in the SOLO1 trial.4
notable differences exist between the SOLO1 and PRIMA populations .
in the PRIMA trial , we enrolled patients who had nonmutated BRCA ovarian cancer .
patients in SOLO1 were at lower risk for disease progression or death as evidenced by prognostic factors , since more patients in SOLO1 than in PRIMA had stage III disease ( 83 % vs. 65 % ) and fewer received neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( 35 % vs. 67 % ) .
most patients with stage III ovarian cancer in SOLO1 underwent primary debulking surgery and had no visible residual disease ( 44 % , vs. 0.4 % in PRIMA ) .
these factors influence outcomes and may explain the observed between @-@ trial differences in the median duration of progression @-@ free survival .
subgroup analysis of the data from SOLO1 showed that in the patients with residual disease after debulking surgery , the treatment effect of olaparib ( progression @-@ free survival of 29.4 months with olaparib vs. 11.3 months with placebo ; hazard ratio , 0.44 ; 95 % CI , 0.25 to 0.77 ) was similar to that of niraparib in patients with BRCA mutations and residual disease in PRIMA ( 22.1 months with niraparib vs. 10.9 months with placebo ; hazard ratio , 0.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.27 to 0.62 ) .23
at the time that we designed the PRIMA trial , bevacizumab had not been approved for first @-@ line treatment in all participating countries , and many patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are ineligible to receive bevacizumab because of safety concerns or limited data regarding first @-@ line use .
the PRIMA trial provides data on the benefit of niraparib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who were receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy , a population of patients who have not been included in the phase 3 trials of bevacizumab ( GOG @-@ 218 and ICON7 ) 2,3 and who have limited or no treatment options beyond chemotherapy .
among the two thirds of patients in the PRIMA trial who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy , the receipt of niraparib was associated with a 41 % lower relative risk of disease progression or death than placebo .
most of the patients receiving niraparib or placebo had an adverse event during the trial .
the frequency of adverse events was greater in the niraparib group than in the placebo group , which was consistent with the class effects of PARP inhibitors .
myelosuppression events were managed with treatment interruptions and dose reductions .
treatment discontinuations occurred in 4.3 % of the patients in the niraparib group because of thrombocytopenia , a finding that was consistent with the results of the NOVA trial .
other adverse events that have been associated with PARP inhibitors , including nausea and fatigue , were of low grade .
one patient in the niraparib group received the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome in the context of bowel perforation , sepsis , and progressive disease .
we found that among patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer , those who received daily oral therapy with the PARP inhibitor niraparib after a response to platinum @-@ based chemotherapy had a significantly longer duration of progression @-@ free survival than those who received placebo .
there was a higher frequency of myelosuppression and low @-@ grade nausea in the niraparib group than in the placebo group .
progression @-@ free survival was inferior with panitumumab alone versus panitumumab plus chemotherapy .
epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -targeted agents with chemotherapy improve response , progression @-@ free survival ( PFS ) , and overall survival ( OS ) in patients with left @-@ sided , RAS wild @-@ type metastatic colorectal cancer ( MCC ) .
recent trials have attempted to deescalate therapy using maintenance treatment with targeted agents alone or combined with chemotherapy .
investigators now report results of the industry @-@ supported , open @-@ label , randomized , noninferiority , phase II VALENTINO trial , in which 229 patients with RAS wild @-@ type MCC received eight cycles of first @-@ line chemotherapy with FOLFOX plus panitumumab and were then randomized to maintenance therapy with panitumumab alone or panitumumab with chemotherapy ( infusional 5 @-@ FU and leucovorin ) .
most patients were male ( 66 % -68 % ) and had the primary tumor resected ( 62 % -64 % ) .
a minority received prior adjuvant therapy ( 15 % -17 % ) , had right @-@ sided primaries ( 16 % -19 % ) , and had BRAF mutation ( 3 % -8 % ) .
at 10 months , PFS ( the primary endpoint ) was inferior with maintenance panitumumab alone versus panitumumab plus chemotherapy ( median 9.9 vs. 12.0 months ) .
OS at median follow @-@ up of 18 months was similar with panitumumab alone or with chemotherapy ( 62.4 % and 66.4 % ) ; rates of response and disease control were also similar in the two arms .
panitumumab plus chemotherapy was associated with higher rates of grade ≥ 3 diarrhea ( 4.7 % vs. 1.3 % ) and grade ≥ 3 stomatitis ( 7.1 % vs. 1.3 % ) .
these results are in agreement with other trials of maintenance therapy suggesting superior disease control for continuing chemotherapy plus targeted therapy compared with targeted therapy alone .
what these trials do not address , however , is the comparison of chemotherapy maintenance with or without the targeted agent .
D @-@ dimer testing identified a higher @-@ than @-@ expected PE prevalence among patients with syncope but without chest pain or dyspnea .
recent literature suggests conflicting estimates of the prevalence of pulmonary embolism ( PE ) in patients who present with syncope .
based on these disparate findings , French investigators performed a prospective cohort study of ≈ 400 patients who presented to seven emergency departments ( EDs ) with syncope but with no symptoms of chest pain or dyspnea .
all patients underwent D @-@ dimer testing , and those with elevated age @-@ adjusted serum D @-@ dimer levels - one third of patients - underwent imaging for PE assessment .
PE was confirmed in nine patients : 6.6 % of patients with positive D @-@ dimer results , 2.2 % of patients overall , and 18 % of patients with cancer ( active or cured within prior 12 months ) .
only one PE was subsegmental .
these results suggest that D @-@ dimer testing as part of the syncope evaluation with might detect more PEs , albeit at the expense of imaging and radiation exposure to more patients .
the FREEDOM trial found that coronary @-@ artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) was better than percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ; performed with first @-@ generation drug @-@ eluting stents ) for patients with diabetes and multivessel disease in terms of long @-@ term major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACEs ) and health status ( NEJM JW Cardiol Dec 2012 and N Engl J Med 2012 ; 367 : 2375 ) .
in this era of precision medicine , we are interested in the heterogeneity of effect - whether some individuals might have different results than in the overall trial .
investigators used data from the FREEDOM trial to develop prediction models for MACEs at 5 years ( the final model had 8 variables ) and angina at 1 year ( 6 variables ) that could lead to individual estimates that might be useful at bedside as part of shared decision making .
the investigators validated the models in a separate cohort of patients .
the findings largely reflected the published trial results .
according to the models , 54 % of participants would be expected to have a better result with CABG than PCI ; in the others , the two approaches had statistically similar risks for adverse events .
all patients with a history of smoking were predicted to do better with CABG .
for angina , 65 % would be better off with CABG than PCI ; and in the rest , the two revascularization approaches showed no differences .
no patients were found to be better off with PCI in either model .
subgroup analyses and analyses with secondary endpoints must be interpreted with caution - and yet , clinicians are interested in taking trial results and providing estimates for individuals .
this post hoc study suggests that some patients with diabetes and multivessel disease are not advantaged by CABG .
what is not clear is how much weight this evidence bears on clinical practice .
whether the outpatient initiation of sacubitril / valsartan therapy has early benefits on patient @-@ reported health status is still unknown .
investigators analyzed the industry @-@ sponsored CHAMP @-@ HF registry to determine if ARNI therapy in patients with HFrEF was associated with changes in scores on the 12 @-@ item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ ; scored 0 @-@ 100 , with higher scores signifying better health ) .
a ≥ 5 @-@ point change is considered clinically significant .
among 508 patients newly prescribed an ARNI and 1016 propensity @-@ score @-@ matched patients not prescribed an ARNI , the baseline KCCQ overall score was 64 , indicating substantial impairment .
after a median of 57 days , the ARNI group experienced a greater improvement in KCCQ overall score , by a mean of 3 points , than the non @-@ ARNI control group .
the difference between groups primarily resulted from improvements in the KCCQ physical limitation and quality @-@ of @-@ life subscores .
there was no difference between patients who switched from an angiotensin @-@ converting @-@ enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin @-@ receptor blocker and those who were started on ARNI therapy de novo .
the researchers found that 44 % of the patients on ARNI and 40 % of those not on ARNI had at least a 5 @-@ point increase in the KCCQ overall score ; 21 % of the ARNI patients and 12 % of the other patients experienced a 20 @-@ point improvement .
in this observational registry , which might reflect the experience in practice , the initiation of ARNI therapy was associated with a modest overall improvement in health status , but many patients experienced a more marked improvement .
these real @-@ world data reinforce the benefit of ARNI therapy and add to the evidence supporting this strategy .
for microscopic cervical cancer , both approaches had similar long @-@ term outcomes ; for stage IB1 disease , radical hysterectomy had superior long @-@ term survival .
how effective is conservative surgery for early @-@ stage cervical cancer ?
in this observational study , investigators queried the National Cancer Database ( 2004 @-@ 2015 ) to study the outcomes of cervical cancer stage IA2 ( microscopic tumors ) and IB1 ( tumors < 2 cm in diameter ) managed with simple or radical hysterectomy .
radical hysterectomy , which involves resection of the uterus along with surrounding parametria , upper vagina , and uterosacral ligaments , typically is performed by gynecologic oncologists .
among 1530 women with stage IA2 and 3931 women with stage IB1 cervical cancer , 45 % and 35 % , respectively , had a simple hysterectomy .
propensity score weighting was used to assess 5 @-@ year survival .
among women with stage IA2 cervical cancer , the 5 @-@ year survival rate in the radical and simple hysterectomy groups was 95.1 % and 97.6 % , respectively ( hazard ratio , 0.70 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.41 @-@ 1.20 ) .
among women with stage IB1 cervical cancer , the 5 @-@ year survival rate in the simple and radical hysterectomy groups was 92.4 % and 95.3 % , respectively ( HR , 1.55 ; 95 % CI , 1.18 @-@ 2.03 ) .
a major goal of cancer surgery is to perform an operation that provides maximal long @-@ term survival with minimal surgical risk and morbidity .
neither vitamin D nor ω @-@ 3 fatty acids slowed decline in function .
vitamin D and ω @-@ 3 fatty acid supplementation have been proposed as biologically plausible interventions to slow decline in renal function among patients with type 2 diabetes .
in this randomized trial , about 1300 people with type 2 diabetes ( mean age , 68 ) received supplementation with ω @-@ 3 fatty acids , vitamin D3 ( 2000 IU / day ) , both , or placebo .
patients had no known cardiovascular disease or cancer ; most were taking medications for hypertension and diabetes .
this analysis was a substudy from the large VITAL trial ( NEJM JW Gen Med Dec 15 2018 and N Engl J Med 2019 ; 380 : 33 ; NEJM JW Gen Med Dec 15 2018 and N Engl J Med 2019 ; 380 : 23 ) .
mean renal function , measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , was 86 mL / minute / 1.73 m2 at baseline .
at 5 @-@ year follow @-@ up , mean decline in eGFR was about 12 to 13 mL / minute in all groups , with no significant differences .
adverse events were similar in all groups .
despite the biologic plausibility of a beneficial effect for vitamin D or ω @-@ 3 fatty acids , these findings indicate that neither compound likely will prevent or slow progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes .
rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology ( " next @-@ generation sequencing " ) have inspired optimism about the potential of human genomics for " precision medicine . "
Meanwhile , pathogen genomics is already delivering " precision public health " through more effective investigations of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses , better @-@ targeted tuberculosis control , and more timely and granular influenza surveillance to inform the selection of vaccine strains .
in this article , we describe how public health agencies have been adopting pathogen genomics to improve their effectiveness in almost all domains of infectious disease .
this momentum is likely to continue , given the ongoing development in sequencing and sequencing @-@ related technologies .
an important transformation is under way in public health .
next @-@ generation sequencing ( also called " high @-@ throughput sequencing " ) is reshaping communicable disease surveillance , allowing for earlier detection and more precise investigation of outbreaks .
next @-@ generation sequencing helps characterize microbes more effectively and offers new insights into their ecology and transmission .
the plethora of sequence data provides raw material for the research and development of new diagnostics and therapeutics .
this article describes how pathogen genomics has been changing public health in the United States and globally .
Adapting Next @-@ Generation Sequencing for Use in Public Health
the era of next @-@ generation sequencing began with the commercial release of massively parallel pyrosequencing in 2005 , the first fundamental advance in sequencing technology since the invention of Sanger sequencing in the 1970s.1,2
in the early years , the efficiency of next @-@ generation sequencing improved rapidly , with sequencing costs falling by as much as 80 % annually.1,3
in public health , these developments were both exciting , because of the myriad potential applications including bacterial whole @-@ genome sequencing , 4 and intimidating , because of the barriers - implementing next @-@ generation sequencing would require investment in sequencing equipment as well as high @-@ performance computing infrastructure to move , store , and analyze large volumes of sequence data .
equally important was the need to integrate bioinformatics , a discipline new to public health .
public Health England was an early leader in the use of next @-@ generation sequencing on a national scale , particularly for tuberculosis5,6 and surveillance for bacterial foodborne diseases.7,8
in the United States , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) was a late adopter9 but is now applying the technology broadly , largely because of the Advanced Molecular Detection program , a $ 30 @-@ million @-@ per @-@ year initiative established by Congress in 2013 to adopt next @-@ generation sequencing and other innovative laboratory technologies - first at the CDC and then at state and local public health departments nationwide - to address infectious disease threats .
applications of Pathogen Genomics
today , pathogen genomics is part of almost every infectious disease program at the CDC.10
some applications of next @-@ generation sequencing that serve specialized purposes , such as reference testing , are in use only at the CDC , while other applications drive entire domestic surveillance systems .
below , we provide examples to highlight the value of next @-@ generation sequencing technology for public health ( Table 1 ) .
bacterial FOODBORNE ILLNESS
in the mid @-@ 1990s , U.S. foodborne disease programs first began applying standardized molecular subtyping by pulsed @-@ field gel electrophoresis to bacterial pathogens as part of routine surveillance , leading to a fundamental change in how outbreaks were identified and investigated .
the resulting national network , " PulseNet , " now includes more than 80 public health laboratories.24
before PulseNet , outbreaks were difficult to detect and solve unless they were large or very geographically and temporally focused .
for example , during the 20 @-@ year period before PulseNet , only 5 outbreaks of listeriosis ( 0.25 per year ) were solved ( i.e. , a food source was identified ) , 25 with a mean of 54 cases per outbreak .
in the 5 @-@ year period after PulseNet began , 11 outbreaks were identified ( 2.2 per year ) , with a median of 5 cases per outbreak.25
routine use of pulsed @-@ field gel electrophoresis had a similar effect on the detection and response to other foodborne bacteria , particularly salmonella26 and Shiga toxin @-@ producing Escherichia coli.11,27,28
PulseNet has now transitioned from pulsed @-@ field gel electrophoresis to whole @-@ genome sequencing.12,29
partners in this effort include the Food and Drug Administration , which created the GenomeTrakr system30,31 to perform whole @-@ genome sequencing of food and environmental isolates , the Department of Agriculture , and the National Center for Biotechnology Information .
whole @-@ genome sequencing offers a vastly finer resolution than pulsed @-@ field gel electrophoresis - typically , a 3 @-@ million @-@ to @-@ 6 @-@ million @-@ bp sequence , in contrast to a gel pattern with 10 to 20 bands that reflect changes in small parts of the genome .
whole @-@ genome sequencing data are inherently digital , standardized , and much less dependent on the choice of laboratory protocol .
the results reveal evolutionary relationships between bacterial isolates , allowing a better understanding of transmission and links between cases ( Figure 1 ) .
whole @-@ genome sequencing can also predict phenotypic characteristics , such as virulence , serotype , and antimicrobial resistance.11,13 @-@ 15,17 @-@ 19
costs for whole @-@ genome sequencing ( approximately $ 200 to $ 250 per isolate , including consumables , labor , equipment , maintenance , and overhead , according to an unpublished analysis ) are currently still higher than those for pulsed @-@ field gel electrophoresis ( approximately $ 100 according to the same analysis ) , although the higher costs may be partly or entirely offset by eliminating the need for traditional phenotyping assays .
in addition , advances in sequencing technology and laboratory automation may further reduce the costs of whole @-@ genome sequencing .
it is too early to know how the transition to whole @-@ genome sequencing will affect U.S. surveillance for more common foodborne pathogens , such as salmonella and Shiga toxin @-@ producing E. coli ; however , early experience with surveillance for listeria , which was switched to routine whole @-@ genome sequencing in 2014 , has been encouraging .
in the first 3 years of whole @-@ genome sequencing ( September 2013 through August 2016 ) , 18 outbreaks of listeriosis were solved ( 6 per year ) , with a median of 4 cases per outbreak.32
in the United Kingdom , where whole @-@ genome sequencing has been in routine use for Shiga toxin @-@ producing E. coli since at least 2015 , the number of clusters detected has doubled.33
tuberculosis
since the 1990s , several DNA fingerprinting technologies have proven useful for subtyping Mycobacterium tuberculosis.34
identifying closely related strains allows health department investigators to detect clusters of cases that may be linked to recent transmission - cases that require more @-@ intense investigation and possible intervention.35
whole @-@ genome sequencing offers subtyping at much finer resolution than was possible with older technologies and thus more confidence in the inferred relationships among cases .
after using whole @-@ genome sequencing selectively for several years , investigators in U.S. tuberculosis control programs have now scaled up the process to sequence isolates from all culture @-@ confirmed cases nationwide .
in California , whole @-@ genome sequencing has allowed public health workers to refute more than half of suspected outbreaks initially identified by conventional genotyping , thereby saving time and resources ( Shaw T , California Department of Public Health : personal communication ) .
early experience in U.K. , 5 Canadian , 36,37 and Dutch38 tuberculosis programs has also confirmed that whole @-@ genome sequencing supports more effective investigations by more accurately defining outbreaks , 5,36,38 providing insights into transmission dynamics , 39 and sometimes suggesting the presence of previously unidentified cases or possible " super @-@ spreaders " that should be prioritized for isolation and treatment.5,36
whole @-@ genome sequencing may also indicate whether recurrent cases are due to reactivation or reinfection , information that is useful in the evaluation of a program 's effectiveness.40
the ability to prioritize case investigations may also be of use in high @-@ incidence , low @-@ income and middle @-@ income countries that carry the world 's heaviest burden of tuberculosis.41
in these countries , however , a different application of next @-@ generation sequencing - sequencing of M. tuberculosis directly from sputum - could have an even more important role.42
direct sequencing of M. tuberculosis from smear @-@ positive sputum samples is already feasible in research settings43 @-@ 45 but is too expensive and cumbersome for routine clinical and public health use .
if the approach can be made practical and cost @-@ effective , it will enable rapid inference of drug susceptibility , which is already quite accurate for most first @-@ line drugs and will improve as more data become available.42,46
in addition to supporting prompt treatment with appropriate drugs , next @-@ generation sequencing will reduce the need for routine phenotypic testing , which is complex , slow , and difficult to maintain in resource @-@ limited laboratory settings .
in the meantime , an intermediate strategy is already practical in high @-@ income countries : whole @-@ genome sequencing directly from early positive cultures , a procedure that provides information on drug susceptibility weeks before the results of traditional tests are available.43
laboratories in both the New York State Department of Health and Public Health England42 have received regulatory approval to forgo traditional drug @-@ susceptibility testing of isolates predicted by whole @-@ genome sequencing to be susceptible to all four first @-@ line drugs ( approximately 70 to 80 % of all isolates ) .42
another promising strategy is amplicon sequencing , an approach that involves targeted polymerase @-@ chain @-@ reaction ( PCR ) amplification of selected mycobacterial genes or marker sequences , followed by sequencing of the resulting amplicons.47
to remain relevant over time , any sequence @-@ based method for inferring drug susceptibility must rely on the continuous updating of databases with correlated genotypic and phenotypic data.42
influenza
the selection of seasonal influenza vaccine candidate strains is a complex , global undertaking , involving massive surveillance efforts from dozens of countries and contributing organizations .
the World Health Organization ( WHO ) convenes international experts twice yearly to review information on circulating influenza strains and , on the basis of that information , to recommend components of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.48
the CDC contributes to this process by overseeing the characterization of 4000 to 10,000 influenza specimens each year.49
next , a few viral isolates are selected for phenotyping , which previously included antigenic characterization and consensus ( Sanger ) sequencing of selected genes .
these steps are time consuming and labor intensive .
next @-@ generation sequencing now enables a more efficient " sequence @-@ first " approach , in which original specimens are subjected directly to whole @-@ genome reverse @-@ transcriptase PCR , followed by sequencing.50 @-@ 52
these sequence data provide a highly granular view of viral emergence and allow for a more parsimonious selection of viruses for phenotypic characterization , including antigenic analysis and susceptibility to antiviral agents .
this approach is not only faster but also more informative .
for example , detailed phylogenetic information on all viral segments provides a richer picture of how influenza viruses are diversifying to evade existing immunity , and deep sequencing ( sequencing many copies of the genome from the same sample ) can reveal the presence of drug @-@ resistant minor variants not reflected in the consensus sequence .
sequencing cannot completely replace traditional phenotyping , but the strategy of sequencing directly from clinical specimens allows for phenotyping to be performed more selectively .
next @-@ generation sequencing data on influenza are now routinely reviewed at the biannual WHO consultations , and the review of such data has already affected decision making about vaccines in at least two major instances , most recently contributing to a change in the A ( H3N2 ) vaccine component to target a newly emerging clade.50,53,54
next @-@ generation sequencing data are also used to forecast the relative importance of emerging strains and assess risk , 55 @-@ 57 characterize viruses used in vaccine effectiveness studies , 58 and inform treatment for patients infected with viruses that have high pandemic risk such as H7N9.59,60
parasitic DISEASES
diagnosis of many parasitic diseases continues to rely on microscopy , a 19th @-@ century technology that is operator dependent and resistant to automation .
PCR and other diagnostic techniques ( e.g. , serology ) have been developed for many common parasites but require separate tests for each suspected pathogen .
the parasitic diseases laboratories at the CDC are developing a new type of diagnostic test based on the targeted amplification and next @-@ generation sequencing of eukaryotic housekeeping genes .
this approach enables the accurate detection of all known potential human parasitic agents present in a blood sample with a single test .
early validation data suggest that this new assay is at least as sensitive as standard PCR for parasites found in blood.61
further validation and development is ongoing , with plans to add more targets and to adapt the assay to more complex samples , including tissue and stool .
PCR amplification and next @-@ generation sequencing of specific genes is an effective means of identifying drug resistance in malaria parasites.62
because such testing takes 2 to 3 days and is still somewhat expensive , its use in routine patient care remains limited .
for surveillance at the country or regional level , however , it is a cost @-@ effective and efficient way to assess drug resistance and to target treatment recommendations more precisely .
protocols based on next @-@ generation sequencing may also be useful for assessing the intensity of transmission by gauging multiplicity of infection among residents in areas in which malaria is endemic.63
Cyclospora cayetanensis causes outbreaks of foodborne diarrheal disease in the United States every year .
the limited genotypic variability of the organism and its inability to be propagated in the laboratory have confounded the development of effective genotyping methods for surveillance .
the CDC has developed a method to extract C. cayetanensis directly from stool and has used the extracts to produce whole genomes of multiple isolates.64
several promising genotyping targets have been identified , and their translation into a functional and discriminatory genotyping tool is showing promise.65
other APPLICATIONS
next @-@ generation sequencing is applicable across the spectrum of important pathogens in public health .
for Legionnaires " disease , for example , finer subtyping has been useful for investigating and responding to outbreaks.66,67
eventually , insights from next @-@ generation sequencing into ecology and persistence of legionella in water systems could improve prevention.68
for hospital @-@ acquired infections , next @-@ generation sequencing is proving to be an invaluable tool for identifying and investigating outbreaks69,70 and also provides a better understanding of transmission at both the hospital70 and the community69,71 level .
community @-@ level molecular surveillance for hepatitis C clusters has also proven useful.75
other applications for next @-@ generation sequencing in public health include tracking the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and new resistant pathogens such as Candida auris , 71,76 tracking insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors of disease , 77,78 monitoring streptococcal pathogens , 20,79 and investigating potential clusters of meningitis.80
sequencing TO SUPPORT OUTBREAK RESPONSE
an important subgroup of next @-@ generation sequencing applications in public health involves outbreak response.81
with respect to bacterial foodborne disease , for example , sequencing is now central to the detection of outbreaks , investigation of cases , and confirmation of the implicated food and then tracing it back to its source .
a very different example comes from the latter phases of the 2014 @-@ 2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea , in which sequencing was useful in ascertaining the likely source of infection in " outlier " cases ( i.e. , those with no known connection to other cases ) .
each outlier raised troubling questions : did the case represent another introduction from an animal reservoir ?
was it attributable to sexual transmission ?
each of these questions would require a different response .
Fortunately , in this outbreak , sequences from outliers were consistently closely related to those in the known outbreak zone , and the response team was able to remain focused on stopping transmission there.10,82
in contrast , sequencing Zika virus during its emergence in the Americas was not useful for responding to individual cases .
however , sequence data were critical in developing diagnostic procedures and vaccines , gaining a better understanding of the evolution of the epidemic , 83 and recently , supporting evidence of an undetected outbreak in Cuba.84
an analysis of Ebola virus genomes after the West Africa outbreak also provided useful insights into the spread of the virus.85
where to Go Next ?
six years into the Advanced Molecular Detection program , next @-@ generation sequencing is now central to U.S. public health programs for monitoring , controlling , and preventing infectious diseases .
progress is currently needed in several areas .
METAGENOMICS
sequencing , particularly bacterial whole @-@ genome sequencing , often requires pure cultures of the organisms , which are increasingly difficult to obtain as clinical laboratories expand the use of highly multiplexed , syndrome @-@ based , culture @-@ independent diagnostic tests.86,87
most immediately , this trend is adversely affecting enteric disease surveillance as clinical laboratories move away from the use of cultures.88
one solution may be to bypass culturing and to sequence pathogen genomes directly from specimens.43,89
although the methods are already feasible for selected organisms in particular specimens , they are not yet practical for routine use .
data INTEGRATION AND DATA SCIENCE
in public health settings , laboratory and epidemiologic data are often stored and managed separately .
until recently , these data could be brought together for analysis without loss of information : laboratory data such as a positive or negative result , a titer , or even a pulsed @-@ field gel electrophoresis pattern identifier could be imported into an epidemiologic database and analyzed with the use of traditional statistical tools .
with pathogen genomic data , this is no longer true : laboratory and epidemiologic data need to be integrated to realize the full value of both.36,90,91
Fortunately , academic researchers are addressing this challenge , 92 producing tools , such as Microreact ( https : / / microreact.org ) , 93 Nextstrain ( https : / / nextstrain.org ) , 94 and the Interactive Tree of Life ( https : / / itol.embl.de ) , for visualizing and analyzing epidemiologic and phylogenetic data together.95
more broadly , the emerging field of data science offers new approaches for integrating , analyzing , and visualizing increasingly diverse public health data.31,96
software TO FACILITATE NEXT @-@ GENERATION SEQUENCING WORKFLOWS
complex workflows are required to manage the sequencing process , analyze raw sequence data , store processed data and integrate it with epidemiologic data , and share information securely .
in a single academic laboratory , it is feasible for a bioinformatician to accomplish this , but in a network of public health laboratories , it can be more practical to manage much of this centrally .
bioinformatics tools are available to accomplish the basic steps of assembling raw sequence data into genomes , and " pipelines " that make use of these tools are available to automate core processes , such as validating quality , assembling a genome , and inferring phenotypes .
however , user @-@ friendly tools for managing workflows and integrating data are often lacking .
in other instances , too many tools exist , and it is not clear which ones will survive the test of time .
challenges
workforce transformation among both microbiologists and epidemiologists , although perhaps the most obvious hurdle , is in some ways the least challenging because of the enthusiasm about genomics .
even recruiting and retaining bioinformaticians has not been as difficult as initially anticipated .
among the first 27 recruits into the Association of Public Health Laboratories @-@ CDC Bioinformatics Fellowship , 19 ( 70 % ) are still working in public health , despite a competitive marketplace .
those who stay in public health often cite the opportunity to have positive social impact as a key motivator .
costs represent a more difficult issue .
at present , sequencing is often more expensive than traditional subtyping .
in addition , to minimize per @-@ sample costs , sequencing technologies such as the MiSeq platform ( Illumina ) may require batch sizes of 15 samples or more , which can extend turnaround times beyond the 36 hours needed for the sequencing itself .
clearly , during a fast @-@ moving outbreak , such delays are undesirable .
single @-@ molecule , long @-@ read sequencing technology , most notably the MinION ( Oxford Nanopore Technologies ) , already has niche uses within public health because of its portability but also has the potential to reduce batch sizes and turnaround times.82
data Openness
in both academia and public health , pathogen genomics is ushering in a new era in data openness .
in the United States , local , state , and federal agencies are uploading data on bacterial foodborne pathogens , 31 influenza , 50 and other pathogens to public databases hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pathogens ) , making these data available in near real time .
these groups also contribute to other global databases , such as the Relational TB Sequencing Knowledgebase ( ReSeqTB ) data platform ( www.reseqtb.org ) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data ( GISAID ; www.gisaid.org ) , established to promote international exchange of sequence and other data .
in addition to enabling secondary uses of data , openness also encourages collaboration among public health organizations , academia , and industry .
nevertheless , openness can never be complete and unconditional : public health agencies have always been vigilant guardians of confidentiality , and pathogen genomic data are released only after careful consideration of risks.91,97,98
next @-@ generation sequencing and bioinformatics are transforming the response to infectious disease outbreaks , providing new insights into disease emergence and transmission , expediting pathogen characterization , and promoting data sharing ( Figure 2 ) .
in public health , sequencing is already routine in many core domains , including foodborne bacterial pathogens , tuberculosis , influenza , and antimicrobial resistance .
these developments are taking place within a rapidly evolving technology landscape : next @-@ generation sequencing is becoming more automated , efficient , and accurate , and related technologies , such as systems for highly multiplexed DNA amplification , are advancing .
development of the public health workforce is central to this process .
microbiologists need a strong knowledge base in microbial genomics .
epidemiologists need the skills and tools to translate genomic data into public health action .
both groups need to grasp the basic vocabulary of bioinformatics .
public health should strive to attract professionals with broadly applicable data @-@ science skills .
for anyone considering a career in public health , this is an exciting time to jump in .
according to Weindruch and Sohal in a 1997 article in the Journal , reducing food availability over a lifetime ( caloric restriction ) has remarkable effects on aging and the life span in animals.1
the authors proposed that the health benefits of caloric restriction result from a passive reduction in the production of damaging oxygen free radicals .
at the time , it was not generally recognized that because rodents on caloric restriction typically consume their entire daily food allotment within a few hours after its provision , they have a daily fasting period of up to 20 hours , during which ketogenesis occurs .
since then , hundreds of studies in animals and scores of clinical studies of controlled intermittent fasting regimens have been conducted in which metabolic switching from liver @-@ derived glucose to adipose cell @-@ derived ketones occurs daily or several days each week .
although the magnitude of the effect of intermittent fasting on life @-@ span extension is variable ( influenced by sex , diet , and genetic factors ) , studies in mice and nonhuman primates show consistent effects of caloric restriction on the health span ( see the studies listed in Section S3 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org ) .
studies in animals and humans have shown that many of the health benefits of intermittent fasting are not simply the result of reduced free @-@ radical production or weight loss.2 @-@ 5
instead , intermittent fasting elicits evolutionarily conserved , adaptive cellular responses that are integrated between and within organs in a manner that improves glucose regulation , increases stress resistance , and suppresses inflammation .
during fasting , cells activate pathways that enhance intrinsic defenses against oxidative and metabolic stress and those that remove or repair damaged molecules ( Figure 1 ) .5
during the feeding period , cells engage in tissue @-@ specific processes of growth and plasticity .
however , most people consume three meals a day plus snacks , so intermittent fasting does not occur.2,6
preclinical studies consistently show the robust disease @-@ modifying efficacy of intermittent fasting in animal models on a wide range of chronic disorders , including obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , cancers , and neurodegenerative brain diseases.3,7 @-@ 10
periodic flipping of the metabolic switch not only provides the ketones that are necessary to fuel cells during the fasting period but also elicits highly orchestrated systemic and cellular responses that carry over into the fed state to bolster mental and physical performance , as well as disease resistance.11,12
here , we review studies in animals and humans that have shown how intermittent fasting affects general health indicators and slows or reverses aging and disease processes .
first , we describe the most commonly studied intermittent @-@ fasting regimens and the metabolic and cellular responses to intermittent fasting .
we then present and discuss findings from preclinical studies and more recent clinical studies that tested intermittent @-@ fasting regimens in healthy persons and in patients with metabolic disorders ( obesity , insulin resistance , hypertension , or a combination of these disorders ) .
finally , we provide practical information on how intermittent @-@ fasting regimens can be prescribed and implemented .
the practice of long @-@ term fasting ( from many days to weeks ) is not discussed here , and we refer interested readers to the European clinical experience with such fasting protocols.13
intermittent Fasting and Metabolic Switching
glucose and fatty acids are the main sources of energy for cells .
after meals , glucose is used for energy , and fat is stored in adipose tissue as triglycerides .
during periods of fasting , triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids and glycerol , which are used for energy .
the liver converts fatty acids to ketone bodies , which provide a major source of energy for many tissues , especially the brain , during fasting ( Figure 2 ) .
in the fed state , blood levels of ketone bodies are low , and in humans , they rise within 8 to 12 hours after the onset of fasting , reaching levels as high as 2 to 5 mM by 24 hours.14,15
in rodents , an elevation of plasma ketone levels occurs within 4 to 8 hours after the onset of fasting , reaching millimolar levels within 24 hours.16
the timing of this response gives some indication of the appropriate periods for fasting in intermittent @-@ fasting regimens.2,3
in humans , the three most widely studied intermittent @-@ fasting regimens are alternate @-@ day fasting , 5 : 2 intermittent fasting ( fasting 2 days each week ) , and daily time @-@ restricted feeding.11
diets that markedly reduce caloric intake on 1 day or more each week ( e.g. , a reduction to 500 to 700 calories per day ) result in elevated levels of ketone bodies on those days.17 @-@ 20
the metabolic switch from the use of glucose as a fuel source to the use of fatty acids and ketone bodies results in a reduced respiratory @-@ exchange ratio ( the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed ) , indicating the greater metabolic flexibility and efficiency of energy production from fatty acids and ketone bodies.3
ketone bodies are not just fuel used during periods of fasting ; they are potent signaling molecules with major effects on cell and organ functions.21
ketone bodies regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules that are known to influence health and aging .
these include peroxisome proliferator @-@ activated receptor γ coactivator 1a ( PGC @-@ 1a ) , fibroblast growth factor 21,22,23 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD + ) , sirtuins , 24 poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP1 ) , and ADP ribosyl cyclase ( CD38 ) .25
by influencing these major cellular pathways , ketone bodies produced during fasting have profound effects on systemic metabolism .
moreover , ketone bodies stimulate expression of the gene for brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor ( Figure 2 ) , with implications for brain health and psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.5
how much of the benefit of intermittent fasting is due to metabolic switching and how much is due to weight loss ?
many studies have indicated that several of the benefits of intermittent fasting are dissociated from its effects on weight loss .
these benefits include improvements in glucose regulation , blood pressure , and heart rate ; the efficacy of endurance training26,27 ; and abdominal fat loss27 ( see Supplementary Section S1 ) .
intermittent Fasting and Stress Resistance
in contrast to people today , our human ancestors did not consume three regularly spaced , large meals , plus snacks , every day , nor did they live a sedentary life .
instead , they were occupied with acquiring food in ecologic niches in which food sources were sparsely distributed .
over time , Homo sapiens underwent evolutionary changes that supported adaptation to such environments , including brain changes that allowed creativity , imagination , and language and physical changes that enabled species members to cover large distances on their own muscle power to stalk prey.6
the research reviewed here , and discussed in more detail elsewhere , 11,12 shows that most if not all organ systems respond to intermittent fasting in ways that enable the organism to tolerate or overcome the challenge and then restore homeostasis .
repeated exposure to fasting periods results in lasting adaptive responses that confer resistance to subsequent challenges .
cells respond to intermittent fasting by engaging in a coordinated adaptive stress response that leads to increased expression of antioxidant defenses , DNA repair , protein quality control , mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy , and down @-@ regulation of inflammation ( Figure 3 ) .
these adaptive responses to fasting and feeding are conserved across taxa.10
cells throughout the bodies and brains of animals maintained on intermittent @-@ fasting regimens show improved function and robust resistance to a broad range of potentially damaging insults , including those involving metabolic , oxidative , ionic , traumatic , and proteotoxic stress.12
intermittent fasting stimulates autophagy and mitophagy while inhibiting the mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) protein @-@ synthesis pathway .
these responses enable cells to remove oxidatively damaged proteins and mitochondria and recycle undamaged molecular constituents while temporarily reducing global protein synthesis to conserve energy and molecular resources ( Figure 3 ) .
these pathways are untapped or suppressed in persons who overeat and are sedentary.12
effects of Intermittent Fasting on Health and Aging
until recently , studies of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting focused on aging and the life span .
after nearly a century of research on caloric restriction in animals , the overall conclusion was that reduced food intake robustly increases the life span .
in one of the earliest studies of intermittent fasting , Goodrick and colleagues reported that the average life span of rats is increased by up to 80 % when they are maintained on a regimen of alternate @-@ day feeding , started when they are young adults .
however , the magnitude of the effects of caloric restriction on the health span and life span varies and can be influenced by sex , diet , age , and genetic factors.7
a meta @-@ analysis of data available from 1934 to 2012 showed that caloric restriction increases the median life span by 14 to 45 % in rats but by only 4 to 27 % in mice.28
a study of 41 recombinant inbred strains of mice showed wide variation , ranging from a substantially extended life span to a shortened life span , depending on the strain and sex.29,30
however , the study used only one caloric @-@ restriction regimen ( 40 % restriction ) and did not evaluate health indicators , causes of death , or underlying mechanisms .
there was an inverse relationship between adiposity reduction and life span29 suggesting that animals with a shortened life span had a greater reduction in adiposity and transitioned more rapidly to starvation when subjected to such severe caloric restriction , whereas animals with an extended life span had the least reduction in fat .
the discrepant results of two landmark studies in monkeys challenged the link between health @-@ span extension and life @-@ span extension with caloric restriction .
one of the studies , at the University of Wisconsin , showed a positive effect of caloric restriction on both health and survival , 31 whereas the other study , at the National Institute on Aging , showed no significant reduction in mortality , despite clear improvements in overall health.32
differences in the daily caloric intake , onset of the intervention , diet composition , feeding protocols , sex , and genetic background may explain the differential effects of caloric restriction on life span in the two studies.7
in humans , intermittent @-@ fasting interventions ameliorate obesity , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , hypertension , and inflammation.33
intermittent fasting seems to confer health benefits to a greater extent than can be attributed just to a reduction in caloric intake .
in one trial , 16 healthy participants assigned to a regimen of alternate @-@ day fasting for 22 days lost 2.5 % of their initial weight and 4 % of fat mass , with a 57 % decrease in fasting insulin levels.34
in two other trials , overweight women ( approximately 100 women in each trial ) were assigned to either a 5 : 2 intermittent @-@ fasting regimen or a 25 % reduction in daily caloric intake .
the women in the two groups lost the same amount of weight during the 6 @-@ month period , but those in the group assigned to 5 : 2 intermittent fasting had a greater increase in insulin sensitivity and a larger reduction in waist circumference.20,27
physical and Cognitive Effects of Intermittent Fasting
in animals and humans , physical function is improved with intermittent fasting .
for example , despite having similar body weight , mice maintained on alternate @-@ day fasting have better running endurance than mice that have unlimited access to food .
balance and coordination are also improved in animals on daily time @-@ restricted feeding or alternate @-@ day fasting regimens.35
young men who fast daily for 16 hours lose fat while maintaining muscle mass during 2 months of resistance training.36
studies in animals show that intermittent fasting enhances cognition in multiple domains , including spatial memory , associative memory , and working memory37 ; alternate @-@ day fasting and daily caloric restriction reverse the adverse effects of obesity , diabetes , and neuroinflammation on spatial learning and memory ( see Section S4 ) .
in a clinical trial , older adults on a short @-@ term regimen of caloric restriction had improved verbal memory.38
in a study involving overweight adults with mild cognitive impairment , 12 months of caloric restriction led to improvements in verbal memory , executive function , and global cognition.39
more recently , a large , multicenter , randomized clinical trial showed that 2 years of daily caloric restriction led to a significant improvement in working memory.40
there is certainly a need to undertake further studies of intermittent fasting and cognition in older people , particularly given the absence of any pharmacologic therapies that influence brain aging and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.12
in this section , we briefly review examples of findings from studies of intermittent fasting in preclinical animal models of disease and in patients with various diseases .
additional published studies are listed in Section S5 .
obesity AND DIABETES MELLITUS
in animal models , intermittent feeding improves insulin sensitivity , prevents obesity caused by a high @-@ fat diet , and ameliorates diabetic retinopathy.41
on the island of Okinawa , the traditional population typically maintains a regimen of intermittent fasting and has low rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus , as well as extreme longevity.42
Okinawans typically consume a low @-@ calorie diet from energy @-@ poor but nutrient @-@ rich sources , particularly Okinawan sweet potatoes , other vegetables , and legumes.42
likewise , members of the Calorie Restriction Society , who follow the CRON ( Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition ) diet , 43 @-@ 45 have low rates of diabetes mellitus , with low levels of insulin @-@ like growth factor 1 , growth hormone , and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.4,20,33,43
a multicenter study showed that daily caloric restriction improves many cardiometabolic risk factors in nonobese humans.46 @-@ 50
furthermore , six short @-@ term studies involving overweight or obese adults have shown that intermittent fasting is as effective for weight loss as standard diets.51
two recent studies showed that daily caloric restriction or 4 : 3 intermittent fasting ( 24 @-@ hour fasting three times a week ) reversed insulin resistance in patients with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.52,53
however , in a 12 @-@ month study comparing alternate @-@ day fasting , daily caloric restriction , and a control diet , participants in both intervention groups lost weight but did not have any improvements in insulin sensitivity , lipid levels , or blood pressure , as compared with participants in the control group.54
cardiovascular DISEASE
intermittent fasting improves multiple indicators of cardiovascular health in animals and humans , including blood pressure ; resting heart rate ; levels of high @-@ density and low @-@ density lipoprotein ( HDL and LDL ) cholesterol , triglycerides , glucose , and insulin ; and insulin resistance.41,43,47,55
in addition , intermittent fasting reduces markers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress that are associated with atherosclerosis.17,27,36,56
analyses of electrocardiographic recordings show that intermittent fasting increases heart @-@ rate variability by enhancing parasympathetic tone in rats57 and humans.58
the CALERIE ( Comprehensive Assessment of Long @-@ Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy ) study showed that a 12 % reduction in daily calorie intake for a period of 2 years improves many cardiovascular risk factors in nonobese persons.46 @-@ 50
Varady et al. reported that alternate @-@ day fasting was effective for weight loss and cardioprotection in normal @-@ weight and overweight adults.59
improvements in cardiovascular health indicators typically become evident within 2 to 4 weeks after the start of alternate @-@ day fasting and then dissipate over a period of several weeks after resumption of a normal diet.57
more than a century ago , Moreschi and Rous described the beneficial effect of fasting and caloric restriction on tumors in animals .
since then , numerous studies in animals have shown that daily caloric restriction or alternate @-@ day fasting reduces the occurrence of spontaneous tumors during normal aging in rodents and suppresses the growth of many types of induced tumors while increasing their sensitivity to chemotherapy and irradiation.7 @-@ 9,60
similarly , intermittent fasting is thought to impair energy metabolism in cancer cells , inhibiting their growth and rendering them susceptible to clinical treatments.61 @-@ 63
the underlying mechanisms involve a reduction of signaling through the insulin and growth hormone receptors and an enhancement of the forkhead box O ( FOXO ) and nuclear factor erythroid 2 @-@ related factor 2 ( NRF2 ) transcription factors .
genetic deletion of NRF2 or FOXO1 obliterates the protective effects of intermittent fasting against induced carcinogenesis while preserving extension of the life span , 64,65 and deletion of FOXO3 preserves the anticancer protection but diminishes the longevity effect.66
activation of these transcription factors and downstream targets by means of intermittent fasting may provide protection against cancer while bolstering the stress resistance of normal cells ( Figure 1 ) .
clinical trials of intermittent fasting in patients with cancer have been completed or are in progress .
most of the initial trials have focused on compliance , side effects , and characterization of biomarkers .
for example , a trial of daily caloric restriction in men with prostate cancer showed excellent adherence ( 95 % ) and no adverse events.67
several case studies involving patients with glioblastoma suggest that intermittent fasting can suppress tumor growth and extend survival.9,68
ongoing trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov focus on intermittent fasting in patients with breast , ovarian , prostate , endometrial , and colorectal cancers and glioblastoma ( see Supplementary Table S1 ) .
specific intermittent @-@ fasting regimens vary among studies , but all involve imposition of intermittent fasting during chemotherapy .
no studies have yet determined whether intermittent fasting affects cancer recurrence in humans.9
neurodegenerative DISORDERS
epidemiologic data suggest that excessive energy intake , particularly in midlife , increases the risks of stroke , Alzheimer 's disease , and Parkinson 's disease.69
there is strong preclinical evidence that alternate @-@ day fasting can delay the onset and progression of the disease processes in animal models of Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease.5,12
intermittent fasting increases neuronal stress resistance through multiple mechanisms , including bolstering mitochondrial function and stimulating autophagy , neurotrophic @-@ factor production , antioxidant defenses , and DNA repair.12,70
moreover , intermittent fasting enhances GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission ( i.e. , γ @-@ aminobutyric acid @-@ related inhibitory neurotransmission ) , which can prevent seizures and excitotoxicity.71
data from controlled trials of intermittent fasting in persons at risk for or affected by a neurodegenerative disorder are lacking .
ideally , an intervention would be initiated early in the disease process and continued long enough to detect a disease @-@ modifying effect of the intervention ( e.g. , a 1 @-@ year study ) .
asthma , MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS , AND ARTHRITIS
weight loss reduces the symptoms of asthma in obese patients.72
in one study , patients who adhered to the alternate @-@ day fasting regimen had an elevated serum level of ketone bodies on energy @-@ restriction days and lost weight over a 2 @-@ month period , during which asthma symptoms and airway resistance were mitigated.17
a reduction in symptoms was associated with significant reductions in serum levels of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.17
multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by axon demyelination and neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system .
Alternate @-@ day fasting and periodic cycles of 3 consecutive days of energy restriction reduce autoimmune demyelination and improve the functional outcome in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis ( experimentally induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis ) .73,74
two recent pilot studies showed that patients with multiple sclerosis who adhere to intermittent @-@ fasting regimens have reduced symptoms in as short a period as 2 months.73,75
because it reduces inflammation , 17 intermittent fasting would also be expected to be beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis , and indeed , there is evidence supporting its use in patients with arthritis.76
surgical AND ISCHEMIC TISSUE INJURY
intermittent @-@ fasting regimens reduce tissue damage and improve functional outcomes of traumatic and ischemic tissue injury in animal models .
preoperative fasting reduces tissue damage and inflammation and improves the outcomes of surgical procedures.77
in animal models of vascular surgical injury , 3 days of fasting reduced ischemia @-@ reperfusion injury in the liver and kidneys and , before the injury , resulted in a reduction in trauma @-@ induced carotid @-@ artery intimal hyperplasia.78
a randomized , multicenter study showed that 2 weeks of preoperative daily energy restriction improves outcomes in patients undergoing gastric @-@ bypass surgery.79
such findings suggest that preoperative intermittent fasting can be a safe and effective method of improving surgical outcomes .
several studies have shown beneficial effects of intermittent fasting in animal models of traumatic head or spinal cord injury .
intermittent fasting after injury was also effective in ameliorating cognitive deficits in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.80
when initiated either before or after cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury , intermittent fasting reduces tissue damage and improves functional outcomes in rats .
however , the potential therapeutic benefits of intermittent fasting in patients with stroke or myocardial infarction remain to be tested .
practical Considerations
despite the evidence for the health benefits of intermittent fasting and its applicability to many diseases , there are impediments to the widespread adoption of these eating patterns in the community and by patients .
first , a diet of three meals with snacks every day is so ingrained in our culture that a change in this eating pattern will rarely be contemplated by patients or doctors .
the abundance of food and extensive marketing in developed nations are also major hurdles to be overcome .
second , on switching to an intermittent @-@ fasting regimen , many people will experience hunger , irritability , and a reduced ability to concentrate during periods of food restriction .
however , these initial side effects usually disappear within 1 month , and patients should be advised of this fact.17,20,27
third , most physicians are not trained to prescribe specific intermittent @-@ fasting interventions .
physicians can advise patients to gradually , over a period of several months , reduce the time window during which they consume food each day , with the goal of fasting for 16 to 18 hours a day ( Figure 4 ) .
alternatively , physicians can recommend the 5 : 2 intermittent @-@ fasting diet , with 900 to 1000 calories consumed 1 day per week for the first month and then 2 days per week for the second month , followed by further reductions to 750 calories 2 days per week for the third month and , ultimately , 500 calories 2 days per week for the fourth month .
a dietitian or nutritionist should be consulted to ensure that the nutritional needs of the patient are being met and to provide continued counseling and education .
as with all lifestyle interventions , it is important that physicians provide adequate information , ongoing communication and support , and regular positive reinforcement .
preclinical studies and clinical trials have shown that intermittent fasting has broad @-@ spectrum benefits for many health conditions , such as obesity , diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular disease , cancers , and neurologic disorders .
animal models show that intermittent fasting improves health throughout the life span , whereas clinical studies have mainly involved relatively short @-@ term interventions , over a period of months .
it remains to be determined whether people can maintain intermittent fasting for years and potentially accrue the benefits seen in animal models .
furthermore , clinical studies have focused mainly on overweight young and middle @-@ age adults , and we cannot generalize to other age groups the benefits and safety of intermittent fasting that have been observed in these studies .
although we do not fully understand the specific mechanisms , the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting involve metabolic switching and cellular stress resistance .
however , some people are unable or unwilling to adhere to an intermittent @-@ fasting regimen .
by further understanding the processes that link intermittent fasting with broad health benefits , we may be able to develop targeted pharmacologic therapies that mimic the effects of intermittent fasting without the need to substantially alter feeding habits .
studies of the mechanisms of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting in animal models have led to the development and testing of pharmacologic interventions that mimic the health and disease @-@ modifying benefits of intermittent fasting .
examples include agents that impose a mild metabolic challenge ( 2 @-@ deoxyglucose , metformin , and mitochondrial @-@ uncoupling agents ) , bolster mitochondrial bioenergetics ( ketone ester or nicotinamide riboside ) , or inhibit the mTOR pathway ( sirolimus ) .12
however , the available data from animal models suggest that the safety and efficacy of such pharmacologic approaches are likely to be inferior to those of intermittent fasting .
experimental and clinical evidence supports the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis and its complications .
colchicine is an orally administered , potent antiinflammatory medication that is indicated for the treatment of gout and pericarditis .
we performed a randomized , double @-@ blind trial involving patients recruited within 30 days after a myocardial infarction .
the patients were randomly assigned to receive either low @-@ dose colchicine ( 0.5 mg once daily ) or placebo .
the primary efficacy end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes , resuscitated cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , stroke , or urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization .
the components of the primary end point and safety were also assessed .
a total of 4745 patients were enrolled ; 2366 patients were assigned to the colchicine group , and 2379 to the placebo group .
patients were followed for a median of 22.6 months .
the primary end point occurred in 5.5 % of the patients in the colchicine group , as compared with 7.1 % of those in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.77 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.61 to 0.96 ; P = 0.02 ) .
the hazard ratios were 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.46 to 1.52 ) for death from cardiovascular causes , 0.83 ( 95 % CI , 0.25 to 2.73 ) for resuscitated cardiac arrest , 0.91 ( 95 % CI , 0.68 to 1.21 ) for myocardial infarction , 0.26 ( 95 % CI , 0.10 to 0.70 ) for stroke , and 0.50 ( 95 % CI , 0.31 to 0.81 ) for urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization .
diarrhea was reported in 9.7 % of the patients in the colchicine group and in 8.9 % of those in the placebo group ( P = 0.35 ) .
pneumonia was reported as a serious adverse event in 0.9 % of the patients in the colchicine group and in 0.4 % of those in the placebo group ( P = 0.03 ) .
among patients with a recent myocardial infarction , colchicine at a dose of 0.5 mg daily led to a significantly lower risk of ischemic cardiovascular events than placebo . ( Funded by the Government of Quebec and others ; COLCOT ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02551094 . )
inflammation appears to play an important role in atherosclerosis.1
inhibition of interleukin @-@ 1β by the injectable monoclonal antibody canakinumab led to a 15 % lower risk of cardiovascular events than was observed with placebo in the Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study ( CANTOS ) but also led to a slightly higher incidence of fatal infections.2
in contrast , methotrexate did not affect cardiovascular outcomes or plasma markers of inflammation in the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial ( CIRT ) .3
in light of these differing results and given that canakinumab has not been approved for cardiovascular prevention , the search for a widely used alternative antiinflammatory treatment that may reduce the risk of atherosclerotic events among patients with coronary artery disease continues .
colchicine is an inexpensive , orally administered , potent antiinflammatory medication that was initially extracted from the autumn crocus and has been used for centuries .
its mechanism of action is through the inhibition of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation and , possibly , effects on cellular adhesion molecules , inflammatory chemokines , and the inflammasome.4 @-@ 6
colchicine is currently indicated for the treatment of gout , familial Mediterranean fever , and pericarditis.7,8
in the Low @-@ Dose Colchicine ( LoDoCo ) trial , patients with stable coronary disease treated with colchicine at a dose of 0.5 mg once daily had fewer cardiovascular events than those not receiving colchicine.9
however , that trial enrolled only 532 patients and was not placebo @-@ controlled .
because acute coronary syndromes are associated with higher risks of recurrent events and exacerbated inflammation , we conducted the Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial ( COLCOT ) to evaluate the effects of colchicine on cardiovascular outcomes as well as its long @-@ term safety profile in patients who had recently had a myocardial infarction .
in this randomized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled , investigator @-@ initiated trial , we assigned patients in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either colchicine ( at a dose of 0.5 mg once daily ) or placebo .
the trial was funded by the Government of Quebec , the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , and philanthropic foundations .
the trial protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org , was designed by the trial steering committee .
the protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each of the 167 centers in the 12 countries that participated in the trial ( see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org ) .
all trial support activities , including project coordination , medical review , data management , site monitoring , and statistical oversight and analyses , were performed at the Montreal Health Innovations Coordinating Center .
potential trial end @-@ point events were adjudicated by an independent clinical end @-@ point committee composed of experienced cardiologists and neurologists who were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments .
the trial was overseen by a data and safety monitoring board of independent experts .
the trial medication and matching placebo were provided by Pharmascience , which had no role in the design or conduct of the trial or in the preparation or review of the manuscript .
the first author and the lead statistician ( also an author ) prepared the first draft of the manuscript , had full access to the trial database , and generated statistical analyses ; they also made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication and assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol .
adult patients were eligible if they had had a myocardial infarction within 30 days before enrollment , had completed any planned percutaneous revascularization procedures , and were treated according to national guidelines that included the intensive use of statins .
patients were excluded if they had severe heart failure , a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35 % , stroke within the previous 3 months , a type 2 index myocardial infarction , coronary @-@ bypass surgery either within the previous 3 years or planned , a history of noncutaneous cancer within the previous 3 years , inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea , neuromuscular disease or a nontransient creatine kinase level that was greater than three times the upper limit of the normal range ( unless due to infarction ) , clinically significant nontransient hematologic abnormalities , severe renal disease with a serum creatinine level that was greater than two times the upper limit of the normal range ; severe hepatic disease , drug or alcohol abuse , current or planned long @-@ term systemic glucocorticoid therapy , or a history of clinically significant sensitivity to colchicine . ( details regarding eligibility criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix . )
written informed consent was obtained from all the patients before enrollment .
clinical evaluations occurred at 1 month and 3 months after randomization and every 3 months thereafter .
the primary efficacy end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes , resuscitated cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , stroke , or urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization in a time @-@ to @-@ event analysis .
the secondary end points consisted of the components of the primary efficacy end point ; a composite of death from cardiovascular causes , resuscitated cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , or stroke ; and total mortality in time @-@ to @-@ event analyses .
coronary revascularization , hospitalization for heart failure , atrial fibrillation , and deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus were prespecified as exploratory end points in the protocol .
additional prespecified exploratory end points included the change from baseline to 6 months in the high @-@ sensitivity C @-@ reactive protein level and the change from baseline to 12 months in the white @-@ cell count .
the C @-@ reactive protein biomarker substudy was implemented after a protocol amendment and was optional for sites and for patients ; 34 sites chose to participate in this substudy .
all serious adverse events were recorded .
the only other adverse events recorded were those that were considered to be related to the gastrointestinal system , events that were judged by the investigator to be related to colchicine or placebo , or laboratory abnormalities that had been judged by the investigator to be clinically significant .
in this event @-@ driven trial , it was estimated that a sample of approximately 4500 patients undergoing randomization ( with 2250 patients in each group ) or , in terms of events , a total number of 301 patients with a first positively adjudicated primary end @-@ point event would yield adequate power .
the sample @-@ size calculation was based on the primary efficacy end point and assumed a 27 % lower risk with colchicine than with placebo , indicated by a hazard ratio of 0.724 .
with the use of a two @-@ sided test at the 0.05 significance level , the trial would have 80 % power if it continued until 301 positively adjudicated primary events occurred in the combined trial groups .
the trial design assumed an event rate of 7 % in the placebo group at 24 months , an 18 @-@ month recruitment period during which patients would be uniformly recruited , a 24 @-@ month minimum follow @-@ up period , and a 1 % annual rate of loss to follow @-@ up or withdrawal of consent .
the efficacy analyses were conducted with the use of positively adjudicated data and according to the intention @-@ to @-@ treat principle .
the primary end point was compared between the two trial groups with the use of a log @-@ rank test , and the hazard ratio , with a 95 % confidence interval , was calculated from a Cox proportional @-@ hazards model .
a Cox proportional @-@ hazards model with adjustment for important baseline characteristics was also used as prespecified in the protocol .
the analysis of the primary end point was repeated in the per @-@ protocol population ( i.e. , patients without major protocol deviations ) .
secondary and exploratory end points expressed as time to event were analyzed similarly .
the changes from baseline to follow @-@ up were analyzed with the use of an analysis of covariance model with adjustment for baseline value , and estimates of treatment effect are presented with 95 % confidence intervals .
the efficacy end points expressed as time to event could be assessed in all patients because the event dates and censoring dates were complete , with the exception of one incomplete event date for atrial fibrillation ; therefore , imputation for missing data was not done .
in the analysis of time to event , the following censoring rules were used .
for death from any cause and death from cardiovascular causes , data from event @-@ free patients who completed the trial were censored at the date of trial completion , and data from patients who did not complete the trial , such as those who were lost to follow @-@ up or who withdrew consent , were censored at the date of last contact or the date of the assessment of survival status , whichever was later .
for the analysis of death from cardiovascular causes , patients who died from a noncardiovascular cause had their data censored at the time of death .
for all other end points , including the primary end point , the same censoring rules applied , but the survival status was not used because no formal assessment of end points was done at the assessment of survival status .
an analysis of the components of the primary end point with death from noncardiovascular causes as a competing event for death from cardiovascular causes , and with death from any cause as a competing event for the other components , was conducted with the use of the Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard model.10
no missing data were imputed except for age in cases in which information on the day or the month and day of birth was missing .
to account for the occurrence of multiple primary end @-@ point events within patients , recurrent @-@ event analyses were undertaken with the use of negative binomial regression , Andersen @-@ Gill , and Wei @-@ Lin @-@ Weissfeld models.11 @-@ 19
an interim analysis was performed after 50 % of the primary end @-@ point events had been positively adjudicated .
the prespecified stopping rule for efficacy was based on the Lan @-@ DeMets procedure with the O 'Brien @-@ Fleming alpha @-@ spending function .
after review of the interim results , the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial should continue as planned .
to account for this interim analysis , the statistical significance level was set to 0.0490 for the final analysis of the primary end point .
all other statistical tests were two @-@ sided and conducted at the 0.05 significance level .
statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software , version 9.4 ( SAS Institute ) .
there was no prespecified plan to adjust for multiple comparisons across the multiple methods that were used to analyze the primary and secondary end points ; results of these analyses are reported with point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals , without P values .
the 95 % confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiple comparisons , and inferences drawn from them may not be reproducible .
the final amendment to the statistical analysis plan was approved on August 28 , 2019 , before unblinding of the trial @-@ group assignments occurred .
trial enrollment began in December 2015 and was completed in August 2018 ; the last trial visit was in July 2019 .
a total of 4745 patients underwent randomization ( with 2366 being assigned to the colchicine group and 2379 to the placebo group ) and were followed for a median of 22.6 months .
at the time of the database lock on August 28 , 2019 , and unblinding on August 29 , 2019 , vital status was available for all except 23 patients ( 99.5 % ) ; 89 patients ( 1.9 % ) were lost to follow @-@ up , and 30 patients ( 0.6 % ) withdrew consent .
details regarding the disposition of the patients are provided in Figure 1 .
at the end of the trial , the trial regimen had been discontinued in 18.4 % of the patients in the colchicine group and in 18.7 % of those in the placebo group .
among the patients who discontinued the trial regimen , the median duration of receipt of the trial drug was 7.1 months ( interquartile range , 1.9 to 14.6 ) in the colchicine group , as compared with 6.1 months ( interquartile range , 1.6 to 14.4 ) in the placebo group .
overall , the median duration of receipt of the trial drug was 19.6 months in the colchicine group and 19.5 months in the placebo group .
clinical EFFICACY END POINTS
a primary end @-@ point event occurred in 5.5 % of the patients in the colchicine group , as compared with 7.1 % of those in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.77 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.61 to 0.96 ; P = 0.02 by the log @-@ rank test ) .
a multivariable Cox regression model with adjustment for baseline covariates yielded a similar result ( Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .
the event curves that were based on a Kaplan @-@ Meier analysis of the primary efficacy end point are shown in Figure 2 .
in the prespecified per @-@ protocol analysis involving patients who adhered to the protocol , the primary end point occurred in 5.1 % of the patients in the colchicine group and in 7.1 % of those in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.71 ; 95 % CI , 0.56 to 0.90 ) ( Table S2 ) .
Table 2 shows the percentages of patients with events and the hazard ratios for the components of the primary end point , including death from cardiovascular causes ( hazard ratio , 0.84 ; 95 % CI , 0.46 to 1.52 ) , resuscitated cardiac arrest ( hazard ratio , 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.25 to 2.73 ) , myocardial infarction ( hazard ratio , 0.91 ; 95 % CI , 0.68 to 1.21 ) , stroke ( hazard ratio , 0.26 ; 95 % CI , 0.10 to 0.70 ) , and urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization ( hazard ratio , 0.50 ; 95 % CI , 0.31 to 0.81 ) .
the hazard ratios remained unchanged in the analysis that took competing events into account .
the secondary efficacy end point consisting of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes , cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , or stroke occurred in 4.7 % of the patients in the colchicine group and in 5.5 % of those in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.85 ; 95 % CI , 0.66 to 1.10 ) .
data on the primary , secondary , and exploratory efficacy end points are provided in Table 2 .
two patients had a first positively adjudicated event of urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization within 14 days after randomization .
the median time to this clinical end point was 258 days .
efficacy results in prespecified subgroups are shown in Table S3 .
the total number of primary end @-@ point events ( first and recurrent ) was 154 in the colchicine group and 223 in the placebo group , over periods of 52,949 and 53,060 patient @-@ months of follow @-@ up , respectively .
thus , the primary end @-@ point event rates per 100 patient @-@ months were 0.29 in the colchicine group and 0.42 in the placebo group ( rate ratio , 0.66 ; 95 % CI , 0.51 to 0.86 ) ( Table S4 ) .
biomarkers OF INFLAMMATION
high @-@ sensitivity C @-@ reactive protein was measured in a subgroup of only 207 patients at the time of randomization and 6 months later , and the median concentration at trial entry was 4.28 mg per liter .
the baseline characteristics of these patients were similar to those of the overall population ( Table S5 ) , but the small and selected subgroup with these data limits the interpretation of these analyses .
the adjusted geometric mean percent changes in the high @-@ sensitivity C @-@ reactive protein level at 6 months after myocardial infarction were − 70.0 % in the colchicine group and − 66.6 % in the placebo group , and the placebo @-@ adjusted geometric mean percent change was − 10.1 percentage points in the colchicine group ( 95 % CI , − 28.6 to 13.4 ) ( Table S6 ) .
information about white @-@ cell counts at baseline and at the 12 @-@ month follow @-@ up were also available for a relatively small subgroup of 1972 patients .
the adjusted geometric mean percent changes from baseline to 1 year in the total white @-@ cell count were − 18.8 % in the colchicine group and − 19.0 % in the placebo group , with no significant difference between groups ( 0.3 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 2.2 to 2.7 ) .
the incidence of adverse events that were considered to be related to the active drug or placebo was 16.0 % in the colchicine group and 15.8 % in the placebo group , and the overall incidence of serious adverse events was 16.4 % and 17.2 % , respectively ( Table 3 ) .
at least one gastrointestinal adverse event during the double @-@ blind period occurred in 17.5 % of the patients in the colchicine group , as compared with 17.6 % of those in the placebo group .
diarrhea was reported in 9.7 % of the patients in the colchicine group and in 8.9 % of those in the placebo group ( P = 0.35 ) , and nausea was more common in the colchicine group than in the placebo group ( 1.8 % vs. 1.0 % , P = 0.02 ) .
pneumonia was reported as a serious adverse event in 0.9 % of the patients in the colchicine group , as compared with 0.4 % of those in the placebo group ( P = 0.03 ) .
in COLCOT , the risk of the primary composite efficacy end point of death from cardiovascular causes , resuscitated cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , stroke , or urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization , as assessed in a time @-@ to @-@ event analysis , was significantly lower among the patients who were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg of colchicine once daily than among those who received placebo .
this result was due predominantly to a lower incidence of strokes and urgent hospitalizations for angina leading to coronary revascularization .
these results were observed against a background of appropriate medications , which included aspirin , a different antiplatelet agent , and a statin in 98 to 99 % of the patients .
in addition , percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 93 % of the patients for their index myocardial infarction .
the benefits of colchicine with regard to cardiovascular end points in COLCOT were at least as large as those of canakinumab in CANTOS.2
in the small subgroup of patients with available data , as expected , a large ( > 65 % ) reduction in the C @-@ reactive protein level occurred over the first 6 months after myocardial infarction in both trial groups in COLCOT , but the difference between the changes in the groups was not significant .
these findings must be interpreted cautiously given that this was a small subgroup that was not randomly selected from the full trial sample .
a similar observation was made with white @-@ cell counts .
the different patient populations involved in the two trials - early after myocardial infarction in COLCOT and stable coronary disease in CANTOS - may also have affected the relationship between biomarkers of inflammation and the effects of treatments on ischemic end points .
the known benefits of colchicine in the treatment of pericarditis were not at play in COLCOT .
postinfarction pericarditis typically occurs within the first few days after the injury , whereas the mean time from the index myocardial infarction to randomization was 13.5 days .
there were only two patients with a first positively adjudicated event of urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization within 14 days after randomization , and the median time to this clinical end point was 258 days .
the most common adverse events observed were gastrointestinal .
diarrhea was reported in 9.7 % of the patients in the colchicine group and in 8.9 % of those in the placebo group , and nausea occurred in 1.8 % and 1.0 % , respectively .
infection as a serious adverse event was more frequent in the colchicine group than in the placebo group ( in 2.2 % vs. 1.6 % of the patients ) , and pneumonia as a serious adverse event was also more frequent in the colchicine group ( 0.9 % vs. 0.4 % ) .
these differences in the incidence of infections could be due to the play of chance or could reflect altered immunologic responses .
in contrast to canakinumab , 2 colchicine did not increase the incidence of septic shock in our trial .
infections have previously been described in patients who have attempted suicide by taking an overdose of colchicine.20
there was no serious adverse event of myopathy linked to colchicine despite the use of statins in 99 % of the patients in the trial .
our trial has certain limitations .
the duration of follow @-@ up was relatively short at approximately 23 months .
the risks and benefits of longer @-@ term treatment with colchicine were not evaluated .
although the inclusion of 4745 patients was sufficient for the trial to show a significant benefit with regard to the primary composite efficacy end point , a larger trial could have allowed a better assessment of individual end points and subgroups and the risks associated with colchicine .
finally , our results apply only to patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction .
in conclusion , among patients with a recent myocardial infarction , colchicine at a dose of 0.5 mg daily led to a significantly lower percentage of patients with ischemic cardiovascular events than placebo .
the American College of Physicians reconciles various published guidelines in its guidance statement for colorectal cancer screening .
sponsoring Organization : American College of Physicians ( ACP )
because guidelines for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening vary in recommended tests and ages to start and stop screening , the ACP graded recommendations from six recent major guidelines ( American College of Radiology , American Cancer Society [ ACS ] , U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care , U.S. Multi @-@ Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [ MSTF ] , and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ) to offer summary guidance .
average @-@ risk adults with life expectancy of > 10 years should start screening at age 50 and should discontinue screening after age 75 .
when comorbid conditions shorten life expectancy , patients might not reap benefits of screening .
CRC screening test selection should be based on patient @-@ clinician shared decision making , with discussion of specific tests ' benefits , harms , costs , availability , and frequency .
positive results on any noncolonoscopy screening test require referral for colonoscopy .
the ACP discussed multitarget stool DNA testing ( Cologuard ) and computed tomography colonography but did not recommend them , because supporting evidence is currently limited .
the ACP does not endorse an earlier screening start age of 45 , which is recommended by the ACS ( for all patients ) and the MSTF ( for black patients ) because of the much lower frequency of CRC in younger patients .
the average time to prevent 1 death from CRC per 1000 people screened ( across the 50 @-@ 75 age span ) is 10.3 years .
this guidance statement does not address symptomatic patients or patients at high risk for CRC ( e.g. , based on positive family history ) .
applying a D @-@ dimer threshold of 1000 ng / mL in patients with Wells scores ≤ 4 decreased imaging and resulted in no missed PE events .
evidence supports adjusting D @-@ dimer thresholds to rule out pulmonary embolism ( PE ) based on age or specific low @-@ risk criteria ( YEARS ) , but prospective evidence is lacking for elevated thresholds across broadly defined " low @-@ risk " patients ( NEJM JW Emerg Med Jul 2017 and Lancet 2017 ; 390 : 289 ; NEJM JW Womens Health May 2019 and N Engl J Med 2019 ; 380 : 1139 ) .
to determine the safety of doubling the D @-@ dimer threshold to rule out PE in low @-@ risk patients , researchers in Canada prospectively enrolled 2017 adults ( 66 % female ; mean age , 52 years ) undergoing PE testing .
all patients were assessed with the Wells clinical prediction rule .
PE was considered ruled out in patients with Wells scores ≤ 4 ( low risk ) if the D @-@ dimer level was < 1000 ng / mL , and in those with scores of 4.5 to 6 ( moderate risk ) if the D @-@ dimer level was < 500 ng / mL .
all other patients underwent chest imaging .
patients in whom PE was ruled out were not given anticoagulant therapy and were followed for 90 days for signs of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) .
Wells scores indicated low risk in 1752 patients , moderate risk in 218 , and high risk in 47 .
PE was diagnosed at the index visit in 7.4 % of patients .
among low- and moderate @-@ risk patients , PE was ruled out in 67 % with D @-@ dimer testing and no imaging .
none of these patients had VTE diagnosed within 90 days .
chest imaging decreased by 18 % .
this game @-@ changing study validates the safety of doubling the D @-@ dimer threshold for ruling out PE in low @-@ risk patients .
although this is only a single study , the criteria for adjusting the D @-@ dimer threshold were similar enough to those in the YEARS studies that I believe these studies validate each other .
I am going to advocate to my practice group that we adjust our practice and protocols .
I am also endorsing using D @-@ dimer at standard cutoff for moderate @-@ risk patients ( Wells score 4.5 @-@ 6 ) but acknowledge the small number of such patients ( 218 ) in this study .
in a large population @-@ based study , metabolic syndrome recovery was associated with fewer cardiovascular events than chronic metabolic syndrome .
metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors that predict adverse cardiovascular events .
investigators analyzed a national South Korean health insurance database to determine how changes in metabolic syndrome status affect cardiovascular risk .
most individuals were in the metabolic syndrome @-@ free group ( 73 % ) .
at a median follow @-@ up of 3.5 years after the third screening , incident MACE was highest in the metabolic syndrome @-@ chronic group ( incidence rate [ IR ] , 8.5 per 1000 person @-@ years ) , followed by the metabolic syndrome @-@ developed , metabolic syndrome @-@ recovery , and metabolic syndrome @-@ free groups ( IRs , 6.0 , 4.6 , and 1.95 per 1000 person @-@ years , respectively ) .
in an analysis of individual components of the metabolic syndrome , changes in hypertension status had the greatest impact on MACE .
in this large , national study from South Korea , investigators found that improvements in metabolic syndrome - even in a relatively short follow @-@ up period - are associated with a reduction in incident MACE .
controlling blood pressure might provide the highest yield in reducing MACE in individuals who have or are at risk for developing metabolic syndrome .
promising evidence that antihypertensive treatment decreases incident dementia and AD risk
hypertension is a risk factor for dementia .
major antihypertensive treatment classes included angiotensin II receptor blockers , angiotensin @-@ converting @-@ enzyme inhibitors , beta @-@ blockers , calcium channel blockers , and diuretics .
participants were classified as normotensive ( blood pressure < 140 / 90 mm Hg ) or hypertensive ( ≥ 140 / 90 mm Hg ) .
normotensive individuals included those with treated hypertension .
incident dementia or AD was determined by accepted criteria .
among 31,090 individuals ( 50 % -60 % women ; mean age , 59 @-@ 77 ; median follow @-@ up , 7 @-@ 22 years ) , 3728 developed dementia and 1741 developed AD .
after accounting for confounding variables ( including smoking , education , and baseline blood pressure ) , in the hypertensive group , antihypertensive use significantly decreased the risks for dementia ( by 12 % ) and AD ( by 16 % ) , compared with those not on antihypertensive medications .
in apolipoprotein E ℇ4 carriers with hypertension , antihypertensive use was associated with a significant 23 % decreased risk for dementia .
no significant differences in dementia or AD risk were seen among antihypertensive medication classes .
in the normotensive group , dementia and AD risk did not differ with versus without antihypertensive use .
treating hypertension with appropriate use of any antihypertensive medication class may decrease dementia risk , even in those with mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) .
the baseline cohorts in this meta @-@ analysis were predominantly white and included individuals with MCI .
whether these promising results also translate to other races requires further study .
during the past 50 years , pediatric aspiration deaths from small toy objects have decreased by 75 % but remain a considerable cause of mortality .
since 1969 , 20,629 deaths occurred from aspiration of small objects .
pediatricians should remind patients of this danger , perhaps by having informative literature available in the office or on websites , especially around the holiday season .
although we can 't say with certainty that the association is causal , clinicians should be aware of these findings about dipeptidyl peptidase @-@ 4 inhibitors .
some studies have suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase ( DPP ) -4 inhibitors are associated with excess risks for pancreatitis ( NEJM JW Gen Med May 1 2017 and Diabetes Care 2017 ; 40 : 164 and 284 ) and pancreatic cancer .
in this population @-@ based cohort study , Korean researchers compared risks for these disorders in 10,000 new users of DPP @-@ 4 inhibitors and 23,000 new users of other diabetes drugs ( excluding glucagon @-@ like peptide @-@ 1 [ GLP @-@ 1 ] agonists ) between 2007 and 2013 .
the overall incidence rates were roughly 10 cases per 1000 patient @-@ years for pancreatitis and 2 cases per 1000 patient @-@ years for pancreatic cancer .
in analyses adjusted for numerous potentially confounding variables , DPP @-@ 4 use was associated with significantly higher risks for pancreatitis ( hazard ratio , 1.27 ; P = 0.007 ) and pancreatic cancer ( HR , 1.81 after a 6 @-@ month lag period ; P = 0.009 ) .
the usual caveats about observational studies apply here , but this study adds to the evidence suggesting that DPP @-@ 4 inhibitors occasionally might cause pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer .
using a new investigational system , patients with type 1 diabetes had blood glucose levels in a target range 71 % of the time .
closed @-@ loop systems for insulin delivery combine an insulin pump , a sensor for continuous glucose monitoring , and automated algorithmic adjustment of basal insulin infusion rates .
in this U.S. trial , 168 patients with type 1 diabetes ( 71 % adults ; 29 % adolescents [ age range , 14 @-@ 17 ] ) were randomized to an investigational closed @-@ loop system ( Control @-@ IQ ) or to a control group ( using an insulin pump augmented by continuous glucose monitoring ) .
at baseline , mean glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) was 7.4 % .
during 6 months of treatment , the percentage of time that blood glucose was in the target range ( 70 @-@ 180 mg / dL ) was significantly higher in the closed @-@ loop group than in the control group ( 71 % vs. 59 % ) .
this outcome reflected less time at both extremes : less time with glucose levels > 180 mg / dL or < 70 mg / dL .
however , the proportion of patients with adverse events was higher in the closed @-@ loop group ( 14 % vs. 4 % ; P = 0.05 ) .
" hyperglycemic events " - 15 @-@ minute periods in which blood glucose exceeded 300 mg / dL - comprised most of this difference and resulted from infusion set failures .
no patient in either group experienced severe hypoglycemia .
if this closed @-@ loop system gains FDA approval , it will be the second one available in the U.S. ( the only currently available system is Medtronic 's MiniMed 670G ) .
these systems offer the promise of improved glycemic control as long as system malfunctions are minimized .
note , however , that current systems still require patients to dose premeal bolus insulin manually .
in the 21st century , physicians in the United States are increasingly caught between the conflicting concepts of medicine as a humanitarian profession and health care as a competitive business .
as a practicing neurologist and clinician @-@ investigator who recently had the privilege of leading the Mayo Clinic for nearly a decade , I have gleaned some lessons and insights that may assist our profession in returning to its core values and essential priorities .
Amid the complexities and changes in health care today , medicine 's most fundamental element remains the relationship between patient and physician .
this relationship at the heart of health care has been a constant across cultures and centuries , and I believe it must remain central to medical practice even as medicine evolves .
in order to ensure that it does so , we can advocate for two important principles that support this relationship .
first , it is critical to enable physicians to spend adequate time with patients who need extra time , such as those with diagnostic uncertainty , those whose treatment plans are failing , and those at the end of life .
second , we need to identify and support the work of a coordinating physician for patients who are seeing multiple specialists , to ensure that everyone is talking with one another and , if there are disagreements , to clarify the diagnosis and treatment plan and help the patient make decisions about next steps .
working together , physician leaders and practicing doctors can take action to bring these elements to their practice .
balancing Humanity and Business
health care ranks as one of the leading domestic issues on the minds of Americans .
even as outstanding U.S. medical centers , at the forefront of scientific discovery , provide some of the finest care in the world , our health care system often struggles to provide reasonable and affordable access to care , suitable approaches to payment , opportunities for innovation , and comprehensive care for patients with complex health issues or multiple coexisting conditions .
health care costs continue to rise despite continued downward pressure on the reimbursement models for hospitals and physicians , and health care administrators must ensure that their organizations perform well financially in an increasingly competitive environment .
patients and families worry about health care costs as well , fearing medical bills and the possibility of personal medical bankruptcy .
not surprisingly , concerns about affordability and greater access to government health care services ( " Medicare for All " vs. a " public option " ) dominate the public dialogue .
at the same time , Americans are grappling with vast societal problems , such as unacceptably high maternal mortality , the tragedy of gun violence , and the opioid crisis , as well as disparities in access to such essential services as early childhood education and healthy nutrition .
when their own health is affected , they seek answers from many sources , including the Web , social media , walk @-@ in clinics , pharmacists , and others - or end up adrift in a fragmented health care system , where they don 't get enough time with their clinicians and they suffer from the lack of a single trusted professional who can help them bring together disparate data points to arrive at unifying answers and a plan .
attending to the business and financial aspects of health care is necessary , but this focus too often overshadows the human side of medicine .
a key attribute of physicians is the commitment to caring for others - the desire to reduce suffering and make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients , often at their time of greatest need .
yet it can seem to physicians that society rarely acknowledges their profession 's efforts to build trust and provide service .
practicing physicians despair that the focus on costs has reduced them to cogs in the health care business machine , with daily reminders of ever @-@ growing productivity expectations on top of crushing regulatory and clerical burdens .
remaining committed to their work , physicians in general have continued to accommodate these added demands .
but in the absence of strong administrative support , investment , and innovation , the results are predictable : loss of joy in work , erosion of professionalism , and ultimately burnout .
the origins of burnout are complex , but the electronic medical record is often cited as a major contributor .
many physicians struggle to use technology in a way that enhances their enjoyment of their practice , and they resent spending more time doing clerical work than seeing patients.1
each week seems to bring more administrative and regulatory intrusion into their practice .
they have heard the promises of a better future , when technology and new models of care will enhance the quality of care and their own professional satisfaction .
but they have yet to see these rewards .
the identification of burnout as a national epidemic has promoted focus and collaboration on addressing it.2 @-@ 5
the profession has invested substantially in research to elucidate and modify the factors contributing to the syndrome.6 @-@ 8
although more remains to be done , these investments have led to important insights that inform our ability to predict , prevent , and alleviate burnout .
I would suggest that the solutions outlined above - allowing more time with patients when needed and designating coordinating physicians to reduce the fragmentation of health care - merit similar consideration .
solutions on these fronts could result in approaches to care that improve outcomes , promote health , reduce wasteful spending , and support a sustainable , rewarding practice of medicine .
I believe the patient @-@ physician relationship will remain fundamental to the future of health care and that we therefore need to invest in it once again .
healing begins when patients and their physicians build trust - a process that often takes time , especially when the patient 's health and future are in jeopardy .
there is no app for that .
the medical profession will have to be creative in finding ways to serve our patients better .
opportunity and Response
insufficient time with patients in need and the lack of care @-@ coordinating physicians are emblematic of the fragmentation of health care , which leads to massive waste , delays , missed opportunities for cure , medical errors , and enormous dissatisfaction on the part of patients and physicians alike .
the benefits to patients , physicians , and society of solving these problems could be enormous .
for starters , eliminating the redundancy and unnecessary work attributable to fragmentation could save an estimated $ 25 billion to $ 45 billion per year.9
from the beginning , the founders of the Mayo Clinic believed that the practice of medicine meant a personal commitment to a life of service that would achieve its best effects if health care professionals worked together in teams .
they have supported the institution through periods of immense disruption ( two world wars , the Great Depression , and now another wave of health care reform ) and , I believe , can help form a strong foundation for future care delivery in the United States , even in systems that lack the Clinic 's resources .
patients who have complex medical issues or multiple coexisting conditions frequently fall through the cracks in our health care system .
they often express frustration that no one is taking responsibility for their total care .
at the same time , all physicians understand that patients who require extra time present a challenge in a busy practice .
in a recent Journal article , Lisa Rosenbaum11 wrote about a group of doctors who were part of a team that was created for critically ill patients with multiorgan involvement and a need for urgent decision making .
the doctors held a Saturday @-@ night telephone conference to analyze one patient 's situation .
we should always practice medicine that way .
the leaders who are responsible for fostering an institution 's culture can take the principles of adequate time and coordinated care into account when they contemplate practice redesign , management of schedules , institutional support for various types of visits , and expectations of physicians .
the simple practice of assigning a coordinating physician to all patients could make intrateam communication and integration of care the norm rather than the exception .
interventions designed to inculcate in the medical staff a strong commitment to collaboration , including rewarding good team play as it leads to better care , would nurture a culture of teamwork and a standard of coordinated care .
action Items
with the pervasive emphasis on costs and efficiency , physicians have seemingly given up on unhurried time with patients .
but we can rethink this norm and fight for our patients .
a sound clinical and business case can be made for spending more time with certain patients .
having adequate time is often essential for reaching an accurate diagnosis and developing an appropriate treatment plan , and conquering those tasks efficiently can ultimately help bend the cost curve in health care .
clearly , not every encounter with a patient needs to be lengthy , nor does every encounter need to be with a physician ; many issues can be managed best by advanced @-@ practice nurses or others .
but having the flexibility to spend more time with patients who need it reduces their suffering and helps both health care organizations and patients save money .
it also boosts satisfaction for physicians .
such changes can be made only if physicians who lead major health care institutions step forward and embrace change .
these leaders can set the expectation that , with their support , physicians will own this opportunity to implement innovations that benefit patients .
there is tremendous power in the partnership of physician and administrative leadership jointly focused on patients " needs .
this approach includes bringing together all the members of a care team to identify the critical problems and then design and test solutions .
several steps are key :
aligning physician engagement , administrative support , and the culture of the practice to effect change .
essentially , every medical practice has a mission statement stressing the primacy of patient care .
Reminding everyone in the organization of that mission may inspire and support patient @-@ focused changes .
institutions with a tradition of physician leadership will have a distinct advantage in moving this agenda forward .
once practicing physicians agree that certain principles are worth fighting for , administrative leaders can be brought on board .
prioritizing identification of opportunities for innovation .
the work of refocusing medicine on humans rather than finances needs to happen within individual practices , specialty groups , and hospitals .
physician leaders can work to achieve a consensus that problems involving issues of time and coordination are worth addressing and provide opportunities to identify innovative solutions .
the magnitude and type of change needed will depend on the practice 's profile .
involving all the members of a team and rethinking the purpose of their work and the skills they bring to the practice .
the amount of time and effort needed to change a practice 's workflow depends on the team 's maturity .
everyone , from the appointment secretary to the nurses and physicians , brings perspectives and insights that can contribute to effective change and collaboration , given sufficient time and trust in the team @-@ building process .
all the team members should be supported to work at their highest level of certification , and efforts at redesign should bring iterative improvements and a commitment to continue to invest in better solutions .
identifying the key barriers to success .
technology should be an enabler to the practice , but electronic health records bring software and functionality issues as well as workflow and training challenges .
each of these challenges requires specific attention and resources , but solutions can be developed if there is broad engagement by care teams .
artificial intelligence , machine learning , and natural language processing offer solutions for patient triage , scheduling , order entry , and documentation , but they carry their own workflow and training challenges .
if the care team is empowered to collaborate on solutions , then technology can take its rightful place as a tool , rather than being a barrier , and tasks such as record review , order entry , and documentation can be offloaded from physicians , allowing them more time with their patients .
creating the role of coordinating physician .
building teams and trust across disciplines is a critical first step .
focusing an assembled group of specialists on the question of how best to meet the needs of the patient may help to address any turf issues and counterproductive practice patterns .
it will be up to the organization to decide , on the basis of the specific case , which practitioner should be designated as the coordinating physician .
building a partnership with administration for long @-@ term support .
redesign efforts are always more difficult and time @-@ consuming than expected .
even the Mayo Clinic , where teamwork is a bedrock principle , must provide constant support , resources , and institutional prioritization for taking time to work in teams - time that is always in short supply in today 's climate focusing on productivity and volume .
relevant resources , such as consultants , seminars , and toolkits to guide practice redesign , also require institutional support .
institutional administrators , particularly in academic medical centers , will need to understand and support sustained investment of resources in change management and health care delivery research .
mobilizing specialty groups to change reimbursement to properly reward additional patient service .
these changes can be made at the local level , for example , by redesigning schedules and templates to build in flexibility based on either individual appointment types or clinic half @-@ days .
ultimately , of course , reimbursement changes need to happen at the payer level , and that will be more difficult .
Revamping payer reimbursement so that it covers time spent with patients and performance of the coordinating physician role will require validation of new metrics , including the speed and accuracy of diagnosis to reduce fragmentation , the appropriate use of diagnostic services to reduce costs , and the use of innovative follow @-@ up visits with various members of the care team , including assembled groups of specialists ( using telemedicine and other digital connections as necessary ) , to improve adherence and outcomes , as well as new measures of patient and physician satisfaction .
leadership for Change
leading change efforts may be difficult , but changes that clearly benefit patients are more likely to succeed than changes that are designed to enhance financial performance .
mobilizing physicians and administrators to reduce the fragmentation of care , with obvious benefits for patients and physicians , will strengthen organizations " culture , engagement , brand strength , and financial performance .
if it is planned well and accepted by physicians and other contributors , the redesigned system will run smoothly .
the right thing to do will be the easy thing to do .
the substantial changes needed to create a high @-@ quality , sustainable health care system can happen only with long @-@ term thinking , societal will , and grit .
the medical profession should be at the center of the effort to fix health care , yet it has gradually been backed into a passive position , as external factors have eroded the centrality of the patient @-@ physician relationship .
active physician leaders can be the voice of the medical profession and speak for the welfare of patients within institutions , specialty groups , and medical societies .
and we can collaborate with the government , payers , life sciences companies , investors , benefactors , and the public to make the system work better for patients as well as their physicians .
my inherent optimism leads me to trust that U.S. society will aspire to create an enviable and sustainable health care system and will ultimately prioritize and realize this goal .
maintaining a focus on patients " needs and the benefits of collaboration may seem dated or nostalgic , but caring for the sick still demands personal interactions , supported by trust , evidence , experience , and technology .
the patient @-@ physician relationship is essential to healing , and it brings meaning and purpose to our profession and our lives .
ubrogepant is an oral , small @-@ molecule calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide receptor antagonist for acute migraine treatment .
we conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy , safety , and side @-@ effect profile of ubrogepant .
we assigned adults with migraine , with or without aura , in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to receive an initial dose of placebo , ubrogepant at a dose of 50 mg , or ubrogepant at a dose of 100 mg for treatment of a single migraine attack , with the option to take a second dose .
the coprimary efficacy end points were freedom from pain at 2 hours after the initial dose and absence of the most bothersome migraine @-@ associated symptom at 2 hours .
secondary end points included pain relief ( at 2 hours ) , sustained pain relief ( from 2 to 24 hours ) , sustained freedom from pain ( from 2 to 24 hours ) , and absence of symptoms associated with migraine ( photophobia , phonophobia , and nausea ) at 2 hours .
a total of 1672 participants were enrolled ; 559 were assigned to receive placebo , 556 to receive 50 mg of ubrogepant , and 557 to receive 100 mg of ubrogepant .
the percentage of participants who had freedom from pain at 2 hours was 11.8 % in the placebo group , 19.2 % in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( P = 0.002 , adjusted for multiplicity , for the comparison with placebo ) , and 21.2 % in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( P < 0.001 ) .
the most common adverse events were nausea , somnolence , and dry mouth ( reported in 0.4 to 4.1 % ) ; these events were more frequent in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( reported in 2.1 to 4.1 % ) .
serious adverse events reported within 30 days in the ubrogepant groups included appendicitis , spontaneous abortion , pericardial effusion , and seizure ; none of the events occurred within 48 hours after the dose .
a higher percentage of participants who received ubrogepant than of those who received placebo had freedom from pain and absence of the most bothersome symptom at 2 hours after the dose .
the most commonly reported adverse events were nausea , somnolence , and dry mouth .
further trials are needed to determine the durability and safety of ubrogepant for acute migraine treatment and to compare it with other drugs for migraine . ( Funded by Allergan ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02828020 . )
migraine is a chronic disease characterized by episodic attacks of headache , sensitivity to light and sound , and nausea .
the major classes of medications for acute migraine treatment are analgesics , including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs , ergots , and triptans.1 @-@ 3
triptans have been the most effective treatment.4
calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide ( CGRP ) is a neurotransmitter expressed in peripheral sensory trigeminal neurons that innervate the pain @-@ sensitive dura and meningeal blood vessels .
the transmitter is released during a migraine attack and facilitates pain transmission in the trigeminovascular system.5
the efficacy of small @-@ molecule CGRP receptor antagonists ( gepants ) for acute migraine treatment has been shown.6 @-@ 10
ubrogepant is an oral gepant for acute migraine treatment.11
we conducted a trial to compare a 50 @-@ mg dose and a 100 @-@ mg dose of ubrogepant with placebo for acute migraine treatment .
this randomized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled , parallel @-@ group trial was conducted at 89 centers in the United States from July 22 , 2016 , to December 14 , 2017 .
participants were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio , with the use of an automated Web @-@ response system , to receive placebo , ubrogepant at a dose of 50 mg , or ubrogepant at a dose of 100 mg .
randomization was stratified according to the participant 's previous response to triptans ( history of a response , history of an insufficient response , or no history of receiving triptans ) and use of preventive medication for migraine ( yes or no ) .
if participants did not take a dose of ubrogepant or placebo to treat a qualifying migraine attack ( i.e. , a migraine headache with moderate or severe pain ) within 60 days after randomization , they were withdrawn from the trial .
there were four clinic visits .
screening was performed at visit 1 , and participants underwent randomization at visit 2 .
visit 3 occurred 2 to 7 days after participants had taken an initial dose to treat a qualifying migraine .
follow @-@ up telephone calls occurred 14 days after the initial dose .
visit 4 was the safety follow @-@ up visit , which occurred 4 weeks after the initial dose .
the protocol , with the statistical analysis plan , is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org .
the trial was approved by a local or central institutional review board at each participating institution .
all participants provided written informed consent before enrollment in the trial .
all the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses , the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , and the completeness of reporting of adverse events .
confidentiality agreements were in place between the sponsor ( Allergan ) and the authors .
the sponsor developed the trial protocol in collaboration with external consultants , provided the trial drug and placebo , and gathered and analyzed the data .
the manuscript was prepared by the sponsor , with contributions from all authors and with assistance from a professional medical writer employed by the sponsor .
participants were eligible if they were 18 to 75 years of age , had at least a 1 @-@ year history of migraine , with or without aura , that met the criteria specified in the International Classification of Headache Disorders , 3rd edition ( beta version ) , 12 and had had migraine onset before the age of 50 years .
participants were required to have a history of migraines that lasted between 4 and 72 hours ( if untreated or if treated unsuccessfully ) and a history of migraine attacks that were separated by at least 48 hours of freedom from headache pain .
in addition , participants had to have a history of two to eight migraines per month with moderate @-@ to @-@ severe headache pain in each of the 3 months before screening .
all participants were required to be able to read , understand , and complete the trial questionnaires and to understand how to use the electronic diary .
participants were excluded if they were pregnant , had a history of 15 or more headache days per month ( on average ) during the 6 months before screening , had a current diagnosis of chronic migraine , or if the investigator had difficulty distinguishing the participant 's migraine from tension @-@ type headaches or other headaches .
however , if the opinion of the local investigator was that participants with chronic migraine had fewer than 15 headache days per month because of concomitant preventive treatment , the participants were eligible for the trial .
trial participants who had taken an acute migraine treatment on 10 or more days in any of the 3 months before screening or who had participated in a trial with an injectable monoclonal antibody against CGRP or the CGRP receptor were excluded .
participants with moderate @-@ to @-@ severe cardiovascular risk factors , as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines , were eligible.13,14
however , participants with clinically significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease were excluded .
participants were also excluded if they had levels of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase that were more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range , a total bilirubin level of more than 1.5 mg per deciliter ( 26 μmol per liter ) , or a serum albumin level of less than 2.8 g per deciliter at screening .
the trial tablets were identical in appearance and were provided to participants in identical blister cards to maintain masking of trial @-@ group assignments .
the participants , site personnel , and trial @-@ sponsor personnel were unaware of the group assignments .
participants were provided with two tablets to be taken at the time of a qualifying migraine attack ( i.e. , an attack of moderate or severe pain intensity ) .
the placebo group received two tablets of placebo , the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group received one 50 @-@ mg tablet of ubrogepant and one tablet of placebo , and the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group received two 50 @-@ mg tablets of ubrogepant .
in the case of persistent or recurring moderate or severe headache , participants were allowed to take an optional second dose or their own rescue medication 2 to 48 hours after the initial dose .
all participants remained unaware of the content of the optional second dose .
participants who took the optional second dose were not allowed to take rescue medication until at least 2 hours after they had taken the second dose .
participants who took rescue medication rather than the optional second dose were not allowed to subsequently take the second dose .
at visit 3 , participants received an additional dose for pharmacokinetic analysis that consisted of the same tablets that the participant received for the initial dose .
efficacy was assessed on the basis of data recorded by the participants in an electronic diary .
participants rated headache severity as no pain , mild pain , moderate pain , or severe pain .
participants also recorded whether nonheadache symptoms associated with migraine ( photophobia , phonophobia , nausea , and vomiting ) were present or absent at various time points : before the initial dose ; at 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 24 , and 48 hours after the initial dose ; at the time of the second dose ; and 2 hours after the second dose .
the coprimary efficacy end points were freedom from pain at 2 hours after the initial dose of ubrogepant or placebo and absence of the most bothersome symptom associated with migraine at 2 hours .
freedom from pain was defined as a change in the severity of headache pain from moderate or severe pain before the initial dose was taken to the presence of no pain at 2 hours after the dose .
the most bothersome migraine @-@ associated symptom ( photophobia , phonophobia , or nausea ) was selected by the participant immediately before taking the initial dose for a qualifying migraine attack ; participants then recorded the presence or absence of that symptom at 2 hours after the dose .
secondary efficacy end points were pain relief ( defined as a change in the severity of headache pain from moderate or severe pain to mild pain or no pain ) at 2 hours after the initial dose , sustained pain relief ( defined as pain relief during the period from 2 to 24 hours after the initial dose without the use of the optional second dose or rescue medication ) , sustained freedom from pain ( defined as freedom from pain during the period from 2 to 24 hours after the initial dose without the use of the optional second dose or rescue medication ) , and absence of photophobia , absence of phonophobia , and absence of nausea , all at 2 hours after the initial dose ( Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org ) .
an exploratory analysis of efficacy over 48 hours was also conducted .
participants were asked to rate their ability to perform normal activities ( a prespecified , exploratory efficacy end point ) with the use of a single @-@ question Functional Disability Scale before the initial dose and at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 hours after the dose .
overall satisfaction with migraine treatment , also a prespecified , exploratory efficacy end point , was evaluated with the use of a 7 @-@ point rating scale ( with higher values indicating greater satisfaction ) at 2 hours and 24 hours after the initial dose .
data on adverse events were collected and evaluated by the investigators , who were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments , 48 hours after the initial dose , 48 hours after the optional second dose , and within 30 days after the last dose .
in addition , results of clinical laboratory testing , results of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale questionnaire ( which evaluates suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior ) , vital signs , and electrocardiograms were assessed .
abnormal hepatic laboratory values were included as a prespecified adverse event of special interest .
all cases of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels that were 3 or more times the upper limit of the normal range were adjudicated by an independent panel of liver experts who were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments .
we calculated that 550 participants per group would provide the trial with at least 85 % power to detect differences in the coprimary end points between each of the two doses of ubrogepant and placebo .
efficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , which included all participants who underwent randomization , took an initial dose of ubrogepant or placebo , recorded a baseline rating for the severity of the migraine headache , and recorded at least one rating for the severity of the migraine headache after the initial dose or recorded the presence or absence of at least one migraine @-@ associated symptom at or before the 2 @-@ hour time point after the initial dose .
safety analyses were performed in all participants who underwent randomization and who took a dose of ubrogepant or placebo .
the primary efficacy variables were evaluated with the use of a logistic @-@ regression model that included the categorical terms of trial group , history of response to triptan , use of medication for migraine prevention , and the predose headache severity of the qualifying migraine .
an additional categorical term for the underlying symptom that was identified as the most bothersome was used for the analysis of the most bothersome nonheadache migraine @-@ associated symptom .
appropriate pairwise comparisons within the logistic @-@ regression model were used to compare each ubrogepant dose with placebo .
treatment comparisons were based on the model @-@ derived odds ratios and their associated 95 % confidence intervals ; two @-@ sided P values are reported .
the last @-@ observation @-@ carried @-@ forward approach was used as the primary method of imputation for missing data after the initial dose or the optional second dose .
in prespecified sensitivity analyses of the primary end points , participants with missing data at the 2 @-@ hour time point after the initial dose were considered to have had treatment failure .
sensitivity analyses were performed with the use of a prespecified generalized linear mixed model for the repeated measures of binary end points at 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , and 2 hours after the initial dose and with a post hoc multiple @-@ imputation method .
the methods used for the analysis of the primary efficacy variables were also used to analyze the secondary end points of pain relief and absence of photophobia , phonophobia , and nausea ; the last @-@ observation @-@ carried @-@ forward method was used for imputation of missing data .
for secondary end points of migraine @-@ associated symptoms , the presence or absence of the symptom at baseline was included as an additional covariate .
the analyses of the efficacy end points of sustained pain relief and sustained freedom from pain included only participants for whom the end point could be determined on the basis of all available data .
in prespecified sensitivity analyses , data for participants for whom those end points could not be determined were included , and these participants were considered not to have had a response .
for each ubrogepant dose , the coprimary efficacy end points served as gatekeepers for the secondary end points .
testing of secondary end points was undertaken only if significance was shown for the difference between the ubrogepant dose and placebo for both primary end points .
within each dose , secondary end points were tested in the order in which they appeared in the list of secondary end points , except for the three migraine @-@ associated symptoms ( absence of photophobia at 2 hours , absence of phonophobia at 2 hours , and absence of nausea at 2 hours ) , which were tested at the same level to allow the recycling of weights among these three symptom end points .
recycling of weights between the two different doses of ubrogepant was also allowed ; there was no hierarchical testing of the two different doses .
the methods used for the primary efficacy analysis were also used to assess the percentage of participants who were able to function normally and the percentage of participants who reported satisfaction with the trial treatment .
the baseline score on the Functional Disability Scale was also included as a covariate for the analysis .
a response was defined as a score on the Functional Disability Scale of " no disability , able to function normally " and a score on the scale of satisfaction with trial treatment of " satisfied " or " extremely satisfied . "
a total of 1672 participants underwent randomization ; 559 were assigned to the placebo group , 556 to the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group , and 557 to the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group .
the safety population included 1436 participants , and the modified intention @-@ to @-@ treat population included 1327 ( Figure 1 ) .
in the safety population , 98.5 % of the participants ( 1414 of 1436 ) completed the treatment period ; the most common reason for discontinuation of the trial was loss to follow up ( 15 of 1327 participants [ 1.1 % ] in the modified intention @-@ to @-@ treat population ) .
among the 1672 participants who underwent randomization , 345 ( 20.6 % ) were excluded from the efficacy analyses : 236 participants did not take the trial treatment , 19 did not record a baseline ( predose ) measurement of the severity of the migraine headache , and 90 did not record a postdose measurement of the severity of the migraine headache or migraine @-@ associated symptoms at or before the 2 @-@ hour time point ( Figure 1 ) .
the number of participants who were excluded was similar in the three groups .
a total of 1436 participants took an initial dose : 485 in the placebo group , 466 in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group , and 485 in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group .
the optional second dose was taken by 222 participants in the placebo group , 184 in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( of whom 107 were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of ubrogepant and 77 to receive placebo for the second dose ) , and 198 in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( of whom 93 were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of ubrogepant and 105 to receive placebo for the second dose ) .
the additional dose of ubrogepant for pharmacokinetic analysis was taken at visit 3 by 424 participants in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group and 453 in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ; these data have not yet been fully analyzed .
the mean age of the participants was 40.5 years , 88.2 % were women , and 82.5 % were white .
at screening , 98.2 % of participants reported that they were using an acute migraine treatment .
immediately before taking the trial tablets for their qualifying migraine , 22.8 % of participants reported that they were using a medication for prevention of migraine , 62.9 % reported that the severity of their migraine headache pain was moderate , 37.1 % reported severe migraine headache pain , and 56.4 % reported photophobia as their most bothersome nonheadache migraine @-@ associated symptom .
no notable differences were observed among groups with regard to baseline demographics or clinical characteristics ( Table 1 and Table S2 ) .
the number of participants with freedom from migraine pain at 2 hours after the initial dose was 54 of 456 ( 11.8 % ) in the placebo group , 81 of 422 ( 19.2 % ) in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( P = 0.002 , adjusted for multiplicity , for the comparison with placebo ) , and 95 of 448 ( 21.2 % ) in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( P < 0.001 ) ( Table 2 ) .
absence of the most bothersome migraine @-@ associated symptom was reported in 126 of 454 participants ( 27.8 % ) in the placebo group , in 162 of 420 ( 38.6 % ) in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( P = 0.002 ) , and in 169 of 448 ( 37.7 % ) in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( P = 0.002 ) .
the results of sensitivity analyses were generally in the same direction as those of the primary analysis .
unadjusted P values for sensitivity analyses with multiple imputation for missing data ranged from P < 0.001 to P = 0.003 for the comparison of 50 mg of ubrogepant with placebo and from P < 0.001 to P = 0.003 for the comparison of 100 mg of ubrogepant with placebo ( Table S3 ) .
among the 871 participants in the two ubrogepant groups , 336 ( 38.6 % ) took the optional second dose ; 174 ( 20.0 % ) received ubrogepant for the second dose .
a total of 131 of 456 participants ( 28.7 % ) in the placebo group , 69 of 423 ( 16.3 % ) in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group , and 68 of 448 ( 15.2 % ) in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group used rescue medication after the first dose ; 96 participants ( 21.1 % ) in the placebo group , 38 ( 9.0 % ) in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group , and 45 ( 10.0 % ) in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group used rescue medication after the optional second dose .
in prespecified exploratory analyses , separation of the ubrogepant treatment groups from the placebo group with respect to the percentage of participants with freedom from pain increased after the 2 @-@ hour time point , with maximum efficacy observed from 3 to 8 hours .
these data are presented in a Kaplan @-@ Meier plot of estimates of the time to freedom from pain and reflect in part the use of the optional second dose or rescue medication ( Figure 2 ) .
the number of participants who had pain relief at 2 hours was 224 of 456 ( 49.1 % ) in the placebo group , 256 of 422 ( 60.7 % ) in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( P = 0.002 , adjusted for multiplicity , for the comparison with placebo ) , and 275 of 448 ( 61.4 % ) in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( P = 0.002 ) ( Table 2 ) .
at 2 hours , 136 of 456 participants ( 29.8 % ) in the placebo group had no disability and were able to function normally , as compared with 171 of 421 ( 40.6 % ) in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( odds ratio vs. placebo , 1.67 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.22 to 2.27 ) and 192 of 448 ( 42.9 % ) in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ( odds ratio vs. placebo , 1.93 ; 95 % CI , 1.42 to 2.61 ) ( Table S4 ) .
results for additional secondary end points are provided in Table 2 .
adverse events that began or worsened within 48 hours after the initial dose or the optional second dose were reported in 12.9 % of participants ( 185 of 1436 participants ) , and events that occurred within 30 days after any dose were reported in 26.3 % of participants ( 378 of 1436 participants ) ; the types and frequencies of events were similar across the groups ( Table 3 ) .
the most commonly reported adverse events that were reported within 48 hours were nausea , somnolence , and dry mouth .
serious adverse events were reported in 5 participants in the ubrogepant groups after 48 hours but within 30 days : in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group , 1 participant had appendicitis , 1 had a spontaneous abortion , and 1 had pericardial effusion ; in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group , 1 participant had appendicitis and 1 had a seizure .
the seizure ( in a participant who may have had alprazolam withdrawal syndrome ) was considered by the investigator to be related to the trial treatment .
details of all reported serious adverse events are provided in Table S5 .
no participants discontinued the trial because of an adverse event .
six participants had postbaseline levels of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase that were at least 3 times the upper limit of the normal range ( 1 participant in the placebo group , 2 in the 50 @-@ mg ubrogepant group , and 3 in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ) ( Table S6 ) .
these cases were adjudicated by an independent review committee whose members were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments ; four of the six cases were considered most likely not related to the trial regimen on the basis of identification of alternative causes or confounding factors .
two cases ( one in the placebo group and one in the 100 @-@ mg ubrogepant group ) were judged to be possibly related to the trial regimen ; confounding factors were noted in both cases .
no case met the criteria for a potential case of Hy 's law ( Table S7 ) .16
in this trial of 50 @-@ mg and 100 @-@ mg doses of ubrogepant for acute migraine treatment , the percentage of participants who had freedom from pain and absence of the most bothersome migraine @-@ associated symptom ( the coprimary end points ) was higher among participants who received either dose of ubrogepant than among those who received placebo .
freedom from pain occurred within 2 hours after a dose in approximately 20 % of participants in each of the ubrogepant groups , as compared with 12 % in the placebo group .
absence of the most bothersome symptom associated with migraine at 2 hours occurred in 38 % of participants who received ubrogepant , as compared with 28 % who received placebo .
although the sites of action of ubrogepant are not known , CGRP receptors are expressed peripherally on cranial blood vessels and on neurons and glial cells in the trigeminal ganglion , as well as centrally on terminals of trigeminal afferents and at multiple sites in the brain stem , cerebellum , and cerebral hemispheres.17
all these are potential signaling sites for CGRP and , correspondingly , potential sites of action of the gepant group of drugs .
this trial had limitations that may preclude generalizability .
second , odds ratios were used as a statistical test and may have magnified the risk ratio .
third , the use of the last @-@ observation @-@ carried @-@ forward method for imputation of missing data in the planned primary analysis may have biased the results ; however , sensitivity analyses under various assumptions confirmed the results of the primary analysis .
fourth , approximately 21 % of the participants who underwent randomization were not included in the efficacy analysis , and the majority of them were excluded because they did not have a qualifying migraine during the 60 @-@ day period after randomization .
finally , safety and side @-@ effect data from this trial were based on evaluation of a single attack , and therefore safety after repeated use cannot be inferred ; an extension trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02873221 ) has assessed the long @-@ term safety of ubrogepant .
at 2 hours after the dose , approximately 20 % of participants who received ubrogepant , as compared with 12 % who received placebo , had freedom from headache pain , and approximately 38 % and 28 % , respectively , had absence of the most bothersome symptom .
trials evaluating consistency of effect , longer @-@ term safety data , and comparative effectiveness are needed to assess the safety and clinical utility of ubrogepant for acute migraine treatment .
globally , hip fractures are among the top 10 causes of disability in adults .
for displaced femoral neck fractures , there remains uncertainty regarding the effect of a total hip arthroplasty as compared with hemiarthroplasty .
we randomly assigned 1495 patients who were 50 years of age or older and had a displaced femoral neck fracture to undergo either total hip arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty .
all enrolled patients had been able to ambulate without the assistance of another person before the fracture occurred .
the trial was conducted in 80 centers in 10 countries .
the primary end point was a secondary hip procedure within 24 months of follow @-@ up .
secondary end points included death , serious adverse events , hip @-@ related complications , health @-@ related quality of life , function , and overall health end points .
the primary end point occurred in 57 of 718 patients ( 7.9 % ) who were randomly assigned to total hip arthroplasty and 60 of 723 patients ( 8.3 % ) who were randomly assigned to hemiarthroplasty ( hazard ratio , 0.95 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.64 to 1.40 ; P = 0.79 ) .
hip instability or dislocation occurred in 34 patients ( 4.7 % ) assigned to total hip arthroplasty and 17 patients ( 2.4 % ) assigned to hemiarthroplasty ( hazard ratio , 2.00 ; 99 % CI , 0.97 to 4.09 ) .
function , as measured with the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) total score , pain score , stiffness score , and function score , modestly favored total hip arthroplasty over hemiarthroplasty .
mortality was similar in the two treatment groups ( 14.3 % among the patients assigned to total hip arthroplasty and 13.1 % among those assigned to hemiarthroplasty , P = 0.48 ) .
serious adverse events occurred in 300 patients ( 41.8 % ) assigned to total hip arthroplasty and in 265 patients ( 36.7 % ) assigned to hemiarthroplasty .
patients with a hip fracture are at substantial risk for death , health complications , and reduced quality of life.1 @-@ 4
despite the high frequency of the injury , the way in which displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients should be managed surgically remains uncertain.2
options include hemiarthroplasty , which involves replacing the femoral head with a prosthesis , or total hip arthroplasty , which involves replacement of both the femoral head and the acetabulum with prostheses .
advocates of total hip arthroplasty perceive benefits with regard to patient function and quality of life as compared with hemiarthroplasty .
there are concerns , however , that total hip arthroplasty has greater associated surgical morbidity than hemiarthroplasty and may increase the risk of dislocation , which often leads to a secondary procedure to reduce or revise the prosthesis.1
meta @-@ analyses of studies involving patients with a displaced hip fracture have suggested that total hip arthroplasty results in fewer reoperations and substantially better function than hemiarthroplasty.4 @-@ 6
we performed the Hip Fracture Evaluation with Alternatives of Total Hip Arthroplasty versus Hemi @-@ Arthroplasty ( HEALTH ) trial , an expertise @-@ based randomized , controlled trial involving patients with a displaced femoral neck hip fracture , to examine the effect that total hip arthroplasty , as compared with hemiarthroplasty , has on the risk of a secondary hip procedure .
our trial was an international , expertise @-@ based , randomized , controlled trial .
details of the trial objectives and design have been published previously.7
additional information about the eligibility criteria , interventions , follow @-@ up , outcome definitions , and statistical analysis are provided in Section S2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org .
the trial was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , the National Institutes of Health , and others .
the funding sources had no role in the design or conduct of the trial ; the collection , management , analysis , or interpretation of the data ; or the preparation , review , or approval of the manuscript for submission .
the Methods Center , located at McMaster University , coordinated the trial and was responsible for randomization , maintenance , validation , data analysis , and trial @-@ center coordination .
Boston Medical Center and New York University assisted in the coordination of trial sites in the United States .
the steering committee , chaired by the principal investigators , designed the trial and the prespecified statistical analysis plan .
the members of the steering committee ( listed in Section S1 ) vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for adherence of the trial to the protocol .
we enrolled patients at 80 participating sites in Canada , the United States , Spain , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Norway , Finland , Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa .
to be eligible for participation , patients had to be 50 years of age or older , had to have a low @-@ energy displaced fracture of the femoral neck that was planned to be treated with surgery , and had to have been able to ambulate without the assistance of another person before the hip fracture occurred .
patients were assigned to undergo either total hip arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty .
minimization was used within each center to ensure prognostic balance between the treatment groups with regard to age , prefracture living setting , prefracture functional status , and American Society for Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status.2,8,9
surgeons , patients , end @-@ point adjudicators , and research coordinators who assessed patient end points were aware of the assigned treatment groups .
the data analyst remained unaware of the treatment groups throughout the trial and while performing analyses .
to facilitate the expertise @-@ based trial design , 10 we set expertise thresholds for surgeons " participation .
among the 523 participating surgeons , 277 of 283 ( 97.9 % ) of those who performed total hip arthroplasty and 369 of 381 ( 96.9 % ) of those who performed hemiarthroplasty met thresholds for surgical expertise .
patients underwent assessment at 1 week , 10 weeks , and 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , and 24 months after surgery , either in person or by telephone .
the primary end point was any unplanned secondary hip procedure within 24 months after the initial surgery .
the procedures included closed and open reductions of a hip dislocation , open reduction of a fracture , full or partial implant exchange , implant removal , implant adjustment , soft @-@ tissue procedure , excision of heterotopic ossification , insertion of an antibiotic spacer , and other events as determined by an independent central adjudication committee .
secondary end points included death , serious adverse events , hip @-@ related complications , health @-@ related quality of life , function , and overall health measures .
assessments of function and quality of life included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) total score ( range , 0 to 96 , with higher scores indicating worse pain , stiffness , and function ; the minimal clinically important difference calculated in different studies ranges from 9 to 22 ) , pain score ( range , 0 to 20 ) , stiffness score ( range , 0 to 8 ) , and function score ( range , 0 to 68 ) 11 @-@ 14 ; the European Quality of Life @-@ 5 Dimensions ( EQ @-@ 5D ) utility index score and visual analogue scale ; the 12 @-@ Item Short Form General Health Survey ( SF @-@ 12 ) physical and mental component summary scores ; and Timed Up and Go ( TUG ) scores .
the central adjudication committee reviewed secondary procedures to confirm the type of and reason for the procedure , as well as to confirm key secondary end points ( death and hip @-@ related complications ) .
separate independent data and safety monitoring boards coordinated by the National Institutes of Health and Canadian Institutes of Health Research monitored trial safety and reviewed all serious adverse events .
in 2006 , during the initial vanguard phase of the trial , which had the primary goal of assessing feasibility , the definitive trial was conceived as a noninferiority trial with an anticipated sample of 2500 patients .
however , during the transition phase to the definitive trial ( 358 patients ) , we made the strategic decision to switch to a more feasible superiority design .
the planned sample size was 1434 patients ( 717 patients per treatment group ) , calculated under the assumption of a 5 % risk of the primary end point in the hemiarthroplasty group at 1 year and a 45 % lower relative risk of the primary end point at 2 years in the hemiarthroplasty group than in the total hip arthroplasty group .
our sample @-@ size calculation reflected the proposed approach to the primary analysis , which used the proportional @-@ hazards model.15
data for a given patient were censored at 24 months of follow @-@ up or at the time of the last follow @-@ up for patients who were lost to follow @-@ up .
the primary analysis was conducted with a proportional @-@ hazards model and a competing @-@ risk framework ( with death as the competing risk ) , with the percentage of patients with a primary end @-@ point event , analyzed in a time @-@ to @-@ event analysis , as the outcome .
the independent variable was the procedure ( total hip arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty ) , and the age , prefracture living setting , prefracture functional status , and ASA status were used as covariates .
for our competing @-@ risk analyses , we reported marginal estimates and used the method described by Zhou et al. to account for clustering of data according to surgeon.16
Cox proportional @-@ hazards modeling was used to estimate the relative effect of total hip arthroplasty as compared with hemiarthroplasty on time to death and serious adverse events .
proportional @-@ hazards modeling with a competing @-@ risk analysis ( with death as the competing risk ) was used to provide a marginal estimate of the relative effect of total hip arthroplasty as compared with hemiarthroplasty on the time to hip @-@ related complications .
we used multilevel models to estimate the effect of total hip arthroplasty as compared with hemiarthroplasty on quality of life , function , and mobility .
in our multilevel analyses , we used joint modeling to account for death , using the method described by Rizopoulos.17
we analyzed the TUG as a dichotomous end point .
for our multilevel analyses of quality of life , function , and mobility , all available data were used , with no imputation performed .
the models did not require that a patient have end @-@ point scores at all follow @-@ up visits .
we chose alpha levels of 0.05 and 0.01 for the primary and secondary end points , respectively .
all tests were two @-@ sided , and no adjustments were made for multiple testing .
before unblinding , we prespecified four subgroup analyses that were conducted to investigate possible effect modification according to age , prefracture living setting , prefracture functional status , and ASA status .
the primary end point was the dependent variable for these analyses .
because these were exploratory analyses , we did not make any adjustment for multiple testing within our subgroup analyses .
we also performed multiple sensitivity analyses .
we first interpreted the results on the basis of a blinded review of the results of our primary analysis.18
the randomization code was then broken , the correct interpretation was chosen , and the manuscript was written .
all analyses were performed with SAS , version 9.4 ( SAS Institute ) , and R , version 3.6.0 ( R Project for Statistical Computing ) .
from January 2009 through May 2017 , we randomly assigned 1495 patients to undergo total hip arthroplasty ( 749 patients ) or hemiarthroplasty ( 746 patients ) .
the final 24 @-@ month assessments were completed in May 2019 .
of the 1495 patients who underwent randomization , 1441 were included in the final analyses .
the majority of patients were female ( 70.1 % ) , 70 years of age or older ( 80.2 % ) , and able to ambulate without the aid of an assistive device before their fracture ( 74.4 % ) , and the injury in the majority of the patients was a subcapital femoral neck fracture ( 61.9 % ) .
the baseline characteristics were similar in the two treatment groups ( Table 1 and Tables S3 through S5 ) .
surgical CARE AND ADHERENCE TO THE ASSIGNED INTERVENTION
a total of 54 patients ( 7.5 % ) who had originally been assigned to total hip arthroplasty received hemiarthroplasty , and 21 ( 2.9 % ) who had originally been assigned to hemiarthroplasty received total hip arthroplasty ( P < 0.001 ) .
the frequency of crossing over did not vary substantially according to country . ( details regarding the patients who crossed over and of surgical and postoperative care are provided in Tables S6 through S10 . )
a secondary hip procedure within 24 months of follow @-@ up occurred in 57 of 718 patients ( 7.9 % ) who had been randomly assigned to total hip arthroplasty and in 60 of 723 patients ( 8.3 % ) who had been randomly assigned to hemiarthroplasty ( hazard ratio , 0.95 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.64 to 1.40 ; P = 0.79 ) ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ) .
the Kaplan @-@ Meier curves show that the assumption of proportional hazards for the primary end point was not met - that is , the hazard ratio for the relative effects of the two interventions changed substantially over time .
post hoc analyses elucidated the nature of this change in effect over time : the risk of a secondary hip procedure up to 1 year was higher in the total hip arthroplasty group than in the hemiarthroplasty group ( hazard ratio , 1.23 ; 95 % CI , 0.82 to 1.86 ; P = 0.32 ) ; after 1 year and up to 2 years , the risk was higher in the hemiarthroplasty group than in the total hip arthroplasty group ( hazard ratio , 0.23 ; 95 % CI , 0.08 to 0.69 ; P = 0.01 ) ( Table S11 ) .
in light of the finding of a non @-@ proportional @-@ hazards function , we conducted a prespecified analysis of the interaction between time and treatment .
sensitivity analyses of various assumptions regarding the risk of the primary end point in patients who were lost to follow @-@ up showed no significant difference between the treatment groups .
all other sensitivity analyses showed results similar to those in the primary analysis .
hip dislocations that were treated with open or closed reduction were the most common secondary procedure in the total hip arthroplasty group ( 33 of 57 procedures ) , and implant revisions were the most common secondary procedure in the hemiarthroplasty group ( 36 of 60 procedures ) .
subgroup analyses did not show any effect modification . ( details regarding the sensitivity and subgroup analyses are provided in Tables S12 , S13 , and S15 . )
over 24 months , 198 of 1441 patients ( 13.7 % ) died .
mortality did not differ significantly between the treatment groups ( 14.3 % in the total hip arthroplasty group and 13.1 % in the hemiarthroplasty group , P = 0.48 ) ( Table 2 ) .
serious adverse events occurred in 300 of 718 patients ( 41.8 % ) in the total hip arthroplasty group and in 265 of 723 patients ( 36.7 % ) in the hemiarthroplasty group ( hazard ratio , 1.16 ; 99 % CI , 0.90 to 1.51 ) ( Table 3 ) .
overall , hip @-@ related complications were more frequent with total hip arthroplasty ( Table 2 ) .
hip instability or dislocation occurred in 34 patients ( 4.7 % ) who were assigned to total hip arthroplasty and 17 patients ( 2.4 % ) who were assigned to hemiarthroplasty ( hazard ratio , 2.00 ; 99 % CI , 0.97 to 4.09 ) .
over 24 months , the functional assessment tests and quality @-@ of @-@ life questionnaires were completed by 943 to 1141 patients ( depending on the test ) at one or more follow @-@ up visits ( Table 4 ) .
patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty had superior function as measured by the WOMAC total score ( mean difference , − 6.37 ; 99 % CI , − 9.18 to − 3.56 ) , WOMAC pain score ( mean difference , − 0.93 ; 99 % CI , − 1.42 to − 0.44 ) , WOMAC stiffness score ( mean difference , − 0.44 ; 99 % CI , − 0.65 to − 0.23 ) , and WOMAC function score ( mean difference , − 4.97 ; 99 % CI , − 7.11 to − 2.83 ) .
these differences between the treatment groups fell below the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference for WOMAC ( range , 9 to 22 points ) .
EQ @-@ 5D visual analogue scale scores , the 12 @-@ Item Short Form General Health Survey ( SF @-@ 12 ) physical and mental component summary scores , and TUG scores did not differ significantly between the treatment groups during follow @-@ up ( Table 4 ) .
the characteristics of the patients who did and those who did not have data included in analyses of health @-@ related quality of life , function , or overall health end points are shown in Table S14 .
among patients with displaced fractures of the femoral neck , we found that the type of arthroplasty had no significant influence on the risk of unplanned secondary hip procedures over 24 months .
functional end points favored total hip arthroplasty over hemiarthroplasty during the 24 @-@ month period .
patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty had a slightly higher incidence of serious adverse events .
strengths of our trial included the concealed randomization , expertise @-@ based design , 10 independent adjudication of primary end @-@ point events , and safeguards against interpretation bias.18
nearly all participating surgeons ( 97.8 % ) met thresholds for surgical expertise .
our trial had certain limitations .
patients and end @-@ point assessors were unblinded in the assessments of function , which left a possibility of bias .
baseline characteristics of patients who were lost to follow @-@ up were similar to those of patients we followed .
sensitivity analyses in which patients in the total hip arthroplasty group who were lost to follow @-@ up were assumed to have had a risk of a primary event that was up to 4 times as high as the risk among those with complete follow @-@ up did not alter our principal findings .
data on function during follow @-@ up were incomplete ; 82.9 % of patients completed at least one follow @-@ up questionnaire over 24 months , with complete data from follow @-@ up questionnaires available for 46.8 % of patients at 12 months and for 42.1 % of patients at 24 months .
we did not use imputation to handle missing data ; however , our analysis model did not require that a patient have end @-@ point scores at all follow @-@ up visits , and it performs well as compared with other approaches for handling missing patient data.19
the follow @-@ up period in our trial may have been insufficient for understanding longer @-@ term end points .
our results differ from those of published meta @-@ analyses reporting that the risk of reoperation associated with total hip arthroplasty is 34 to 43 % lower than with hemiarthroplasty.4 @-@ 6
this difference may , in part , be the consequence of longer follow @-@ up periods in these meta @-@ analyses ( ranging from 1 to 13 years ) or potential differences in our eligibility criteria.4 @-@ 6
our inclusion of patients who could ambulate independently before the fracture occurred ( i.e. , patients who did not require the assistance of another person to ambulate ) is consistent with previous trials.6
although the use of assistive devices was balanced between the treatment groups , we did not record the type of assistive device or the specific ambulatory capacity of the patients .
data on 17,985 femoral neck fractures over a period of 16 years from the Australian Joint Registry suggest that modern hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty have similar incidences of revision over 10 years ( hazard ratio , 1.13 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 to 1.33 ; P = 0.16 ) .20
a large multicenter trial involving 298 patients with femoral neck fractures in Scotland showed no significant difference in the incidence of secondary hip procedures at 2 years ( hazard ratio , 0.81 ; 95 % CI , 0.24 to 2.81 ; P = 0.74 ) .21
our subgroup analyses did not show any effect modification according to patient age , the use of assistive devices for ambulation , ASA status , or living status at the time of fracture .
the larger number of events in the hemiarthroplasty group during the second year is in keeping with the possibility of more events being associated with that procedure over the long term .
a meta @-@ analysis reported significantly fewer complications with total hip arthroplasty than with hemiarthroplasty ( relative risk , 0.75 ; 95 % CI , 0.60 to 0.94 ; P < 0.05 ) .4
in our trial , the incidence of serious adverse events was slightly higher in the total hip arthroplasty group than in the hemiarthroplasty group .
serious adverse events were not driven by a specific type of complication ; rather , total hip arthroplasty broadly led to more cardiac , renal , vascular , neurologic , and respiratory events than hemiarthroplasty .
the incidence of dislocation after total hip arthroplasty in our trial was high ( 4.7 % ) .
pooled estimates from randomized , controlled trials suggest a risk of dislocation after total hip arthroplasty that is more than 2.5 times as great as that associated with hemiarthroplasty ( 9 % vs. 3 % ; relative risk , 2.53 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 to 6.10 ) .5
although limited comparative data are available , total hip arthroplasty has consistently been associated with better function and quality of life than hemiarthroplasty in previous studies.4 @-@ 6
our findings showed slightly but significantly lower WOMAC scores ( indicating better function ) in the total hip arthroplasty group , as well as trends that favored total hip arthroplasty in EQ @-@ 5D , SF @-@ 12 scores , and TUG test times .
however , the differences in WOMAC scores were deemed clinically unimportant on the basis of the thresholds for the minimal clinically important difference.12,13
the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend total hip arthroplasty in all patients with displaced femoral neck fractures who are able to ambulate independently.22,23
our findings suggest that the advantages of total hip arthroplasty may not be compelling .
the limited advantages of total hip arthroplasty , as well as the possible higher risk of complications , may be particularly important in regions of the world where total hip arthroplasty is not easily accessible or is cost @-@ prohibitive .
in our trial , the incidence of secondary procedures after 2 years did not differ significantly between the total hip arthroplasty group and the hemiarthroplasty group .
total hip arthroplasty was associated with modestly better function over 24 months but with a slightly higher incidence of serious adverse events than hemiarthroplasty among independently ambulating patients with displaced femoral neck fractures .
out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest is a major public health issue.1 @-@ 5
in the United States , an estimated 155,000 persons per year are treated by emergency medical services ( EMS ) for out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest , and approximately 8 % survive.6
in Europe , annual occurrence is estimated to be 128,000 to 275,000 persons , and approximately 10 % survive.3,7,8
substantial variations exist , both within countries and across the globe , with respect to data collection and reporting methods and with respect to survival and neurologic outcome.3 @-@ 11
a key concept in the successful treatment of patients with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest is the strategy known as the " chain of survival , " which emphasizes a system @-@ of @-@ care approach that includes early access to care and consists of five key links : early recognition of cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency @-@ response system ; immediate , high @-@ quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) ; rapid defibrillation ; basic and advanced EMS ; and advanced life support and postarrest care.12
research in cardiac arrest resuscitation has affirmed that the most important links in the chain of survival are the earliest ones - recognition of cardiac arrest and initiation of CPR , both of which are performed largely by lay bystanders.13
lay rescuers therefore play a major role in the resuscitation of people with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest .
physicians have a role in helping to make the lay public aware of the importance of bystander contribution to favorable outcomes .
in addition , although physicians are not directly involved in bystander response to cardiac arrest , they should know how to support these resuscitation efforts , encourage appropriate education for lay providers , and advocate for placement of automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) for public access .
the Concept of Prearrival Care
the first components of the chain of survival can be termed " prearrival care " ( Figure 1 ) , defined here as basic medical interventions initiated by bystanders before trained medical providers arrive on the scene .
these components include recognition of cardiac arrest and call for emergency assistance , initiation of CPR , and use of an AED .
prearrival care is associated with substantial improvements in survival and neurologic status.14 @-@ 17
bystander @-@ initiated CPR significantly increases the chance of survival ; application of an AED also markedly increases the chance of survival.15,16
the combination of bystander CPR and AED use has a synergistic positive effect on outcome.17
the delivery of prearrival care - and its effect on a patient 's neurologically intact survival - is time @-@ sensitive ( Figure 2 ) ; for every minute that a person with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest goes without CPR and defibrillation , the chance of survival decreases by 7 to 10 % .19
unfortunately , bystander CPR is provided in less than 50 % of cases20 ; AEDs are used even less often , in no more than 25 % of appropriate patients , even though they are frequently available in public places.21,22
data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival show considerable variation among 132 U.S. counties with respect to survival ( ranging from 3.4 to 22 % ) and neurologic outcome ( ranging from 0.8 to 21.0 % ) ; these variations in outcome are attributed partially to varying frequencies of bystander CPR performance and AED use.11
regional and national education and awareness efforts have resulted in increased bystander intervention and associated improvements in outcome , 16,23 but considerable work will be required to overcome the many remaining barriers.24
lay Recognition of Cardiac Arrest
one of the primary reasons for infrequent bystander intervention in out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest is that lay rescuers may fail to recognize cardiac arrest .
cardiac arrest may be mistaken for syncope or seizure .
furthermore , persons with cardiac arrest may have continued gasping respirations for several minutes , 25 which can confuse lay rescuers and lead to delays in bystander care.26
to overcome this confusion , the 2010 American Heart Association ( AHA ) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care eliminated the " look , listen , and feel " approach for bystanders , which it had previously emphasized , and instead recommended immediate activation of the emergency @-@ response system and initiation of chest compressions for any adult who is unresponsive and either is not breathing or is having gasping respirations.27
to further simplify the initial assessment for the lay provider , the 2015 guidelines from the AHA , 28 the European Resuscitation Council ( ERC ) , 29 and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation ( ILCOR ) 30 recommend that bystanders should suspect cardiac arrest and begin CPR whenever a person is unresponsive and not breathing normally.28 @-@ 30
educational efforts should be targeted at helping the lay public understand that persons with cardiac arrest can initially have seizurelike activity or abnormal respirations and that every effort should be made to minimize delays in initiating care .
abnormal breathing can involve either the absence of respirations or agonal respirations ( slow and deep breaths , often with a gasping quality ) .
if the lay rescuer does not realize that cardiac arrest is present , algorithms used by the emergency communications center dispatcher can aid in identification of the medical emergency ; the appropriate response can then be initiated and telephone guidance provided .
interventions Assisted by the Emergency Communications Center Dispatcher
recognition of a medical emergency , including collapse with possible cardiac arrest , should be followed by prompt activation of the emergency @-@ response system.12
in many areas , the emergency @-@ response system is activated by a call to an emergency communications center .
the first responsibility of personnel at the emergency communications center is to dispatch appropriate EMS units to the scene of the medical emergency .
once EMS units have been activated , the dispatcher can then provide additional resources to assist the lay responder in providing appropriate prearrival care .
impediments to the implementation of dispatcher instructions by the lay responder include language barriers , emotional stress , and lack of awareness of the importance of prearrival care .
the dispatcher in the emergency communications center can begin by assisting the caller in determining whether cardiac arrest has occurred .
in general , dispatchers are able to identify the presence of cardiac arrest in approximately 70 % of cases , 31 @-@ 33 and once they recognize the presence of cardiac arrest , they can provide instructions for resuscitation if the callers are willing to perform CPR .
a dispatcher 's verbal approach to the caller influences the likelihood that the bystander will perform CPR before the arrival of EMS .
specific phrases such as " We are going to do CPR " and " We need to do CPR " imply a sense of futurity and obligation and are more likely to result in the bystander performing CPR.34
dispatcher directions also increase rates of return of spontaneous circulation , survival , and favorable neurologic status among survivors of cardiac arrest.35,36
in addition to guiding CPR , the dispatcher may be able to direct the caller to the location of the closest registered AED .
this strategy of identifying and deploying the closest AED has been quite successful in simulation studies37 but has been found to be less effective in studies of real @-@ world dispatch programs.38,39
in one analysis , among cardiac arrests in which the dispatchers knew that publicly accessible AEDs were available and informed bystanders of their location ( which was a minority of the total number of cardiac arrests ) , AEDs were successfully retrieved and used in only 14 % of the cases.39
one practical issue in whether an AED is used is that typically at least two rescuers must be present - one to perform CPR and another to retrieve the AED .
while instructions are being relayed by telephone , the dispatcher can alert others in the community about the cardiac arrest through text messaging and other smartphone @-@ based applications .
this approach notifies lay responders who have voluntarily agreed to join these digital response efforts of an occurrence of out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest in their immediate vicinity , provides information about the arrest and location , and , in some cases , alerts them to the presence of adjacent public @-@ access AEDs.40
although this is a new strategy , early investigations are promising ; studies have shown increased frequency of early CPR and associated improved survival and functional status among survivors.41,42
this strategy is formally supported by the AHA.43
finally , the dispatcher may have the ability to send an AED to the scene by drone .
this approach is still investigational , but early system modeling suggests that an AED can arrive at the scene considerably earlier by drone than by standard EMS vehicle , with the time to arrival at the scene of the cardiac arrest reduced by 6 minutes in urban settings and by 19 minutes in rural settings.44 @-@ 46
cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
CPR is a method of external chest compressions and artificial respirations that provides perfusion to vital organs during cardiac arrest until definitive treatment is available .
there are two basic approaches to CPR : the conventional method , which is performed with both chest compressions and ventilations , and a newer method , termed compression @-@ only CPR , which is performed with only chest compressions .
some debate remains regarding the benefits of traditional CPR as compared with compression @-@ only CPR.28 @-@ 30
central oxygen saturation levels are likely to be normal at the moment of cardiac arrest ; because several minutes may pass before oxygen saturations fall to critical levels , immediate initiation of ventilations may not be necessary .
in addition , bystander mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth ventilations are often ineffective and unlikely to provide any meaningful oxygenation for the patient ; they can produce excessive intrathoracic pressure with negative effect on perfusion .
furthermore , ventilations can detract from high @-@ quality chest compressions and timely defibrillation .
the benefits of lay rescuer ventilations early in cardiac arrest , particularly if the ventilations are delivered by untrained bystanders , are therefore questionable .
studies comparing patients who received conventional CPR with those who received compression @-@ only CPR have shown no significant difference in survival.47 @-@ 49
compression @-@ only CPR is associated with better acceptance and engagement by lay rescuers , 50 who may hesitate to provide conventional CPR because of fear of performing the procedure incorrectly , concern about victim regurgitation during mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth ventilations , or anxiety regarding disease transmission.51,52
to overcome these barriers , in 2010 the AHA endorsed compression @-@ only CPR for untrained lay rescuers ; the 2015 AHA , ERC , and ILCOR guidelines continue to support this recommendation.28 @-@ 30
nonetheless , the ability to perform CPR remains a concern for the public .
in a recent survey53 of participants in CPR training sessions in the United States , trainees were asked about their willingness to perform CPR on various persons having a cardiac arrest ( male and female adolescents , a middle @-@ aged woman , and an elderly man ) as well as their potential specific concerns about doing so .
less than 65 % of participants said that they were moderately or extremely likely to perform CPR on the victims .
the most commonly expressed concerns included the possibility of causing injury to the patient , a lack of appropriate CPR training , the need to unclothe a female patient 's chest and expose her breasts , and the fear of sexual assault accusations .
regardless of the method used , the importance of bystander CPR has been shown in numerous studies .
in a 2010 report of 10,681 cases of out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest , Rea et al. found that 22.1 % of patients who received bystander CPR , as compared with 7.8 % of patients who did not receive bystander care , survived.54
bystander CPR can prolong the time period within which successful resuscitation can occur and can thus allow for longer EMS response times.14 @-@ 16,18
one potential mechanism by which CPR extends the successful resuscitation time period is by prolonging the presence of the shockable cardiac arrest rhythms - ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia .
a study of 2772 patients in the London Ambulance Service database showed that the percentage of shockable rhythm cases was 48 % among patients with witnessed cardiac arrest who received bystander CPR , as compared with 27 % among those who did not receive bystander CPR ; a similar trend was noted in cases of unwitnessed cardiac arrest ( 31 % vs. 18 % ) .56
similar results were noted among 34,125 patients included in the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Register over a 14 @-@ year period ; furthermore , fewer defibrillation attempts were needed to achieve return of spontaneous circulation in patients who had received bystander CPR.57
the benefit of bystander CPR increased as the time to initial defibrillation increased.58
feedback devices that support and encourage providers to perform high @-@ quality chest compressions are in use by professional rescuers both in and outside the hospital setting .
at this time , real @-@ time feedback for the lay rescuer is limited to AED @-@ delivered audible prompts that provide CPR instructions .
many AEDs also have audible alert sounds that provide a rhythm and cadence to assist the lay rescuer in performing an appropriate rate of chest compressions .
automated External Defibrillators
AEDs are portable devices that automatically analyze the cardiac rhythms of patients with cardiac arrest and deliver defibrillatory shocks if either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia is detected .
rhythm diagnosis is not a component of lay bystander care ; for the lay provider , the only distinction between shockable and nonshockable rhythm presentations is provided by an audible message from the AED stating " shock advised , " which indicates that either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia has been detected by the device .
among persons with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest , shockable initial rhythms ( noted in 7.7 to 32.0 % of patients ) occur significantly less often than nonshockable rhythms and are associated with a better prognosis than nonshockable rhythms.59 @-@ 63
operation of the AED by either trained or untrained rescuers is guided by audible prompts from the unit as well as graphical directions on the device .
although AED design differs slightly by manufacturer , the basic elements of operation are the same in the various devices .
the user is instructed to turn the device on and to bare the patient 's chest .
the defibrillator pads must be opened and their protective backing removed ; they are then positioned on the patient 's chest according to the graphics shown on the AED .
the AED then analyzes the patient 's cardiac rhythm , and if a shockable rhythm is detected , the user is instructed to press a button that delivers the defibrillatory shock .
AEDs can be deployed in public locations for use by lay providers as part of a public @-@ access defibrillation program .
the potential lifesaving advantages of AEDs in public locations have been investigated extensively .
in a recent systematic review of 41 studies of public @-@ access defibrillation , the median percentage of patients who survived to hospital discharge was 53.0 % when defibrillation was performed by lay first responders as compared with 28.6 % when defibrillation was performed by EMS personnel ( Figure 3 ) .64
in 2018 , the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium investigators reported the results of a comparison of defibrillation with a bystander @-@ applied AED and defibrillation by EMS in nearly 50,000 out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrests in nine U.S. regions.65
the investigators reported that 66.5 % of patients in whom defibrillation was performed by bystanders , as compared with 43.0 % in whom defibrillation was performed by EMS , survived to hospital discharge ; in addition , hospital discharge with a favorable neurologic outcome was more commonly seen among patients in whom defibrillation had been performed by bystanders than among those in whom defibrillation had been performed by EMS ( 57.1 % vs. 32.7 % ) .
among all observed out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrests , bystanders applied an AED in 15.9 % of cases.65
the benefit of bystander AED @-@ delivered defibrillation increased as EMS response times became longer.65
in 2019 , Nehme et al. reported the results of a study66 of out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest defibrillation performed by bystanders , first responders , and paramedics , and reported the resultant outcomes for an 18 @-@ year period ( 2000 @-@ 2017 ) .
when comparing the initial ( 2000 @-@ 2002 ) and final ( 2015 @-@ 2017 ) 2 @-@ year segments of the study period , the authors noted an overall increase in the number of patients in whom defibrillation was performed by bystanders ( from 2.0 % to 11.2 % ) and first responders ( from 3.8 % to 8.2 % ) .
over this same period , they reported a significant increase in survival to hospital discharge regardless of whether defibrillation was performed by bystanders , first responders , or paramedics ( P < 0.001 for all three groups ) ; however , the increase was greater among patients in whom defibrillation was performed by bystanders ( from 6.7 % to 55.5 % ) than among patients in whom defibrillation was performed by first responders ( from 10.5 % to 37.8 % ) and paramedics ( 11.6 % to 28.8 % ) .
AEDs are especially useful when placed in public places where there is a reasonable probability of a witnessed cardiac arrest within a defined period of time.67
the AHA and ERC recommend that AEDs are best placed in locations such as airports , rail terminals , casinos , and sports arenas29,30 or in locations in which there is at least one cardiac arrest every 5 years.29
AED placement in commercial aircraft is required by many nations , including the United States .
unfortunately , placement of AEDs in private homes has not been shown to be beneficial ; in one study of more than 7000 high @-@ risk patients ( those who had previous anterior myocardial infarctions ) , placement of an AED in the home did not improve overall survival.68
estimates of the cost @-@ effectiveness of public @-@ access AEDs vary , ranging from approximately $ 40,000 to $ 80,000 per quality @-@ adjusted life @-@ year ( QALY ) gained when AEDs are placed in shopping malls or sports arenas to more than $ 1 million per QALY gained for AEDs placed in less densely populated areas.69
although AEDs offer many benefits , there are challenges to their use by lay providers .
studies suggest that even in regions in which active efforts have been made to position public @-@ access AEDs widely , less than 10 % of out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrests occur within 100 m of an AED.38,70
furthermore , many AEDs that are installed in the community are located inside buildings such as schools , business offices , and sports facilities that are not accessible to the public during evenings , at night , or on weekends71,72 ( Figure 4 ) .
in addition , when the ability of untrained laypersons to operate AEDs was evaluated , substantial variation in ability was observed.73
both graphical and audible directions for defibrillator pad placement are important.74
finally , although AED use is potentially lifesaving , operating an AED may cause the bystander to be distracted from performing CPR.75
lay Provider Education
to provide effective bystander care , a layperson must be able to recognize the presence of cardiac arrest , call for help , begin CPR , and use an AED ( if one is readily available ) .12
unfortunately , the ability of lay bystanders to recognize cardiac arrest and perform CPR is not uniform across communities , which has resulted in variable application of bystander CPR .
it is estimated that only approximately 2.4 % of the U.S. population undergoes CPR training each year .
areas with low rates of CPR training correspond to regions of the U.S. in which the outcome of cardiac arrest is less favorable.76
training should include provision of information as well as deliberate practice , with a focus on repetition with feedback , until mastery is obtained.77
traditional CPR classroom courses normally take 3 to 4 hours and require an on @-@ scene instructor .
to maximize the number of laypersons trained in CPR , many innovative teaching methods are being studied or are already in use , including installation of CPR kiosks in public locations ( Figure 5 ) , mass training of hundreds or thousands of people in stadiums , instructional role @-@ playing games , and use of virtual reality programs.12,78,79
courses that use videos ranging in length from 60 seconds to 8 minutes may be effective in training people to perform compression @-@ only CPR.80
a 4 @-@ minute kiosk @-@ based training session , including video instruction and practice sessions with feedback , appears to be more effective than video instruction alone.81
many national and international organizations have called for universal CPR training .
the World Health Organization has endorsed the " Kids Save Lives " training initiative , which recommends that school @-@ age children receive 2 hours of CPR training annually.78
the AHA has a stated goal of training 20 million people per year in CPR by 2020,80 and ILCOR has launched the " All Citizens of the World Can Save a Life " program to increase CPR training and performance.82
the report " Strategies to Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival : a Time to Act " of the Institute of Medicine ( IOM , now the National Academy of Medicine ) recommends that physicians ... " foster a culture of action through public awareness and training " in cardiac arrest management.51
physicians should support this approach by encouraging the public to participate in prearrival care , endorsing appropriate lay provider education , and advocating for placement of public @-@ access AEDs .
physicians should also make the public aware of the substantial effect bystander care has on survival .
the IOM report also refers to " The Power of Multiple Initiatives " - the benefit of approaching this major public health issue from multiple strategic directions simultaneously with education , training , and resource implementation.51
the multiple @-@ initiatives approach emphasizes cardiac arrest recognition , call for assistance , CPR performance , and AED application.51
if these prearrival measures are initiated early in out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest , they have the potential to significantly increase the likelihood of meaningful survival .
a medication used typically for diabetes type 2 helps patients with heart failure , including those without diabetes .
evidence is growing that sodium @-@ glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitors can reduce the risk for heart failure ( HF ) in patients with type 2 diabetes .
many people have wondered whether these drugs can be beneficial for patients with HF , including those without diabetes .
to examine the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin , researchers conducted the industry @-@ funded , phase 3 , placebo @-@ controlled DAPA @-@ HF trial ( NCT03036124 ) , which enrolled 4744 patients with New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class II or higher HF and an ejection fraction of ≤ 40 % ( mean age , 66 ; 23 % women ) .
in both groups , 45 % of patients had type 2 diabetes .
about two thirds of the participants were in NYHA class II , mean ejection fraction was 31 % , and mean systolic blood pressure was 122 mm Hg .
almost half of the patients had histories of HF hospitalization .
patients were generally treated with guideline @-@ recommended therapies ; 26 % had an implantable cardioverter @-@ defibrillator .
the medication was dosed at 10 mg daily .
at a median follow @-@ up of 18 months , the primary combined outcome ( worsening HF [ hospitalization or an urgent visit for intravenous therapy ] or cardiovascular death ) occurred in significantly fewer of the dapagliflozin group than the placebo group - 16.3 % versus 21.2 % ( hazard ratio , 0.74 ) .
the benefit was consistent across subgroups , including those without diabetes .
dapagliflozin was statistically better in measures of worsening HF ( 9.7 % vs. 13.4 % ) and cardiovascular death ( 9.6 % vs. 11.5 % ) .
deaths from any cause also favored dapagliflozin ( 11.6 % vs. 13.9 % ) , as did symptoms .
no important safety issues were raised with dapagliflozin .
this is a remarkable , practice @-@ changing study .
dapagliflozin , in patients with established HF and a reduced ejection fraction , produced few symptoms and lowered risks for all @-@ cause mortality , cardiovascular death , and worsening HF .
this diabetes drug seems to be a highly effective heart failure drug .
the size and methods of this Apple Watch study are groundbreaking , but it raises more questions than it answers .
the Apple Watch has an optical sensor that can detect heart rates , thus introducing the possibility of detecting atrial fibrillation ( AF ) .
the industry @-@ sponsored , prospective , open @-@ label , siteless , pragmatic Apple Heart Study tested an algorithm to identify AF ( NCT03335800 ) .
the 419,297 adult U.S. participants enrolled via an app , owned Apple Watches and iPhones , and had no prior AF .
during the study , 2161 people were notified of an irregular pulse , of whom 79 % were excluded for various reasons , including 1216 who failed to attend a telemedicine visit .
the researchers urgently contacted 20 people : 18 with AF and a rate > 200 beats / minute , 1 with a pause > 6 seconds , and 1 with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia > 6 seconds .
for confirmation , electrocardiographic patches were mailed to 658 participants with nonurgent symptoms .
participants began wearing the patches about 13 days after the notification , for about 6 days .
of 450 people who returned the patches , AF was confirmed in 153 ( 34 % ) ; 20 % had continuous AF .
the yield was higher in older than younger people .
of 293,015 participants who never received a notification and who returned an end @-@ of @-@ study survey , 3070 reported new AF diagnoses .
however , as an assessment of this approach , the study has many limitations .
large percentages of patients were lost to follow @-@ up .
also , the confirmation method 's sensitivity is unknown - many patients might have had intermittent AF .
overall , the algorithm caught some AF episodes and missed others .
as clinicians , we should not rely on the Apple Watch , but neither can we ignore these results .
we certainly need more study about how to optimize such tools and , especially , how to best respond to brief , intermittent , subclinical AF episodes .
however , the benefit was not seen in patients with the most severe injuries .
the CRASH @-@ 2 trial demonstrated that administration of tranexamic acid ( TXA ) decreased mortality for patients with traumatic hemorrhage ( NEJM JW Emerg Med Jul 2010 and Lancet 2010 ; 376 : 23 ) .
given that fewer than 250 of the 20,000 patients had isolated traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , it was unclear whether TXA would have similar benefits in this population ( NEJM JW Emerg Med Jan 2012 and BMJ 2011 ; 343 : d3795 ) .
the recent CRASH @-@ 3 trial , conducted in 29 countries over 6 years , aimed to provide clarification .
roughly 9200 patients with isolated TBI ( Glasgow Coma Scale [ GCS ] score < 13 or any intracranial bleeding on computed tomography scan ) who were treated within 3 hours of injury were randomized to TXA ( 1 g bolus over 10 minutes , followed by 1 g infusion over 8 hours ) or placebo .
overall , there was no significant difference in head injury @-@ related death at 28 days ( the primary outcome ; risk ratio [ RR ] , 0.94 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.86 @-@ 1.02 ) .
however , preplanned subgroup analyses showed reductions in mortality with TXA for patients with mild @-@ to @-@ moderate injury ( GCS > 8 ; RR , 0.78 ) and those with bilaterally reactive pupils ( RR , 0.87 ) .
secondary analyses showed better outcomes with earlier treatment in patients with mild @-@ to @-@ moderate injury ( but not those with severe injury ) and no difference in survivors ' degree of disability or thromboembolic events between the TXA and placebo groups .
we would not expect TXA to decrease mortality in the most severely ill patients , so the finding of a mortality reduction only for patients with mild @-@ to @-@ moderate injury has face validity .
reassuringly , these data also confirm the CRASH @-@ 2 findings of improved outcomes with faster treatment and no increase in thrombotic complications after administration of TXA .
while some physicians may disagree based on the primary outcome ( which included all patients ) , I 'll be administering TXA to patients with intracranial bleeding and mild @-@ to @-@ moderate TBI .
circulating tumor DNA after surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy was independently associated with excess risk for disease recurrence .
adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to confer a modest incremental survival benefit for patients with stage III colon cancer ( N Engl J Med 2004 ; 350 : 2343 ) .
recent studies support reducing the duration of adjuvant therapy from a standard 6 months to 3 months for lower @-@ risk patients ( NEJM JW Oncol Hematol May 2018 and N Engl J Med 2018 ; 378 : 1177 ) .
prognostic biomarkers to identify lower @-@ risk patients have been limited to tumor location , T stage , and N stage at surgery .
to determine the prognostic value of circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) in this setting , investigators in Australia conducted a multicenter , population @-@ based , cohort study of 96 patients with newly diagnosed stage III colon cancer who had at least 1 of 15 tumor @-@ specific DNA mutations ( aka , ctDNA ) commonly found in colon cancer .
results at a median follow @-@ up of 28.9 months were as follows :
disease recurrence was higher in the 21 % of patients with detectable ctDNA after surgery than in those without ctDNA after surgery ( hazard ratio , 3.8 ; P < 0.001 ) .
disease recurrence at 3 years was higher in the 17 % of patients with detectable ctDNA after adjuvant chemotherapy than in those without ctDNA after chemotherapy ( 70 % vs. 30 % ; HR , 6.8 ; P < 0.001 ) .
conversion from positive to negative ctDNA status after chemotherapy resulted in lower recurrence compared with persistent positive status ( HR , 3.7 ; P = 0.04 ) .
in a multivariate analysis , ctDNA status after surgery had the strongest independent association with recurrence among the clinicopathological variables studied , including age , gender , T stage , N stage , lymphovascular invasion , and clinical risk .
these results suggest that ctDNA is emerging as a powerful prognostic marker in colon cancer and may identify patients with excess risk for disease recurrence after surgery and after adjuvant chemotherapy during a 3 @-@ year interval .
trials are planned and underway using this biomarker to guide adjuvant therapy decisions and potentially intensify therapy in ctDNA @-@ positive patients .
observational data suggest that women might have better outcomes with drug doses lower than those for men .
several studies have documented higher plasma drug concentrations with the same medication doses in women than in men , but guideline @-@ recommended doses of cardiovascular medications are the same regardless of sex .
to understand whether certain medications should be dosed differently for men and women , investigators studied angiotensin @-@ converting @-@ enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , angiotensin @-@ receptor blockers ( ARBs ) , and β @-@ blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) .
the investigators performed a post hoc analysis of BIOSTAT @-@ CHF , a prospective study of 2516 patients with worsening signs or symptoms of HF who were considered to be receiving suboptimal medical treatment .
patients who died within the first 3 months were excluded .
women were older than men ( 74 vs. 70 ) , weighed less ( 72 vs. 85 kg ) , and were shorter ( 162 vs. 174 cm ) but did not have significantly different body @-@ mass index from men .
in men , the lowest risk for death or hospitalization for HF occurred at the full recommended dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β @-@ blockers .
for women , however , the lowest risk for death or HF hospitalization occurred at only 50 % of the recommended doses , and the risks did not further decrease at higher doses , even after adjustment for covariates .
to validate these findings , the investigators analyzed data from ASIAN @-@ HF , a study of 4500 patients with HFrEF .
similar patterns were observed .
the authors noted that women suffered more and more @-@ severe adverse effects than men at the full medication doses .
these findings suggest that women with HFrEF may experience similar benefits as men and fewer adverse effects at lower doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and β @-@ blockers .
of course , these observational data are potentially confounded , and the post hoc analysis cannot prove the optimal doses for women .
nevertheless , the data support sex @-@ specific studies to analyze optimal drug doses .
in a longitudinal cohort study , use of e @-@ cigarettes in nontraditional flavors was associated with greater odds of continued vaping at 6 months .
flavored e @-@ cigarettes are used commonly by adolescents .
the FDA prohibits flavors other than menthol and tobacco for conventional cigarettes , but these policies do not apply to e @-@ cigarettes .
to investigate whether adolescents who use e @-@ cigarettes in nontraditional flavors are more likely to continue vaping , researchers enrolled 3396 ninth @-@ graders from Los Angeles schools .
written surveys were administered every 6 months over 4 years .
among 478 participants with at least one exposure to e @-@ cigarettes , 94 % used nontraditional flavors , with fruit and candy being the most common .
compared with use of traditional flavors ( tobacco , menthol , mint ) or flavorless e @-@ cigarettes , use of nontraditional flavors was associated with greater odds of continued vaping at 6 months ( adjusted odds ratio , 3.76 ) and with greater number of puffs per vaping episode .
these findings are not surprising .
flavored e @-@ cigarettes may increase nicotine addiction because they include compounds that can increase nicotine 's absorption .
appealing e @-@ cigarette flavors should be discontinued , and much stricter regulation of these products developed for children and adolescents .
pediatricians can add this information to their discussions with patients about the harms of vaping .
Dr. Joshua Salvi ( Medicine ) : a 66 @-@ year @-@ old man with a history of pancytopenia was transferred to this hospital in the winter for evaluation of pancytopenia and rash .

radiography of the chest revealed atelectasis but was otherwise normal .
computed tomography ( CT ) of the chest , performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material , revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and no evidence of lymphadenopathy ; CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal hepatic parenchyma , a moderate amount of ascites , mild splenomegaly , and no evidence of lymphadenopathy .
positron @-@ emission tomography ( PET ) from the skull base to the thighs , performed after the administration of intravenous 18F @-@ fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) tracer , revealed homogeneous FDG uptake in the spleen , and there was no evidence of hypermetabolism in the abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes .
the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and management of possible hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) .
Dr. Valentina Nardi : examination of a bone marrow biopsy specimen and aspirate that were obtained at the other hospital revealed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mildly hypercellular marrow with many histiocytes and numerous engulfed erythroid elements in the cytoplasm .
the findings were consistent with hemophagocytosis , with no evidence of infection or lymphoma ( Figure 1 ) .
Dr. Kristine M. Cornejo : a punch biopsy of an erythematous lesion on the right thigh was performed at the other hospital .
microscopic examination of the specimen revealed focal epidermal erosion with impetiginized scale crust and a mild lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue ; no fungal organisms were identified .
the infiltrate lacked atypia , and there was no evidence of hemophagocytosis .
the findings were nondiagnostic , and there was no evidence of lymphoma ( Figure 2 ) .
Dr. Salvi : intravenous fluids , cryoprecipitate , and empirical cefepime were administered .
differential Diagnosis of HLH
Dr. Marcela V. Maus : I am aware of the diagnosis in this case .
this 66 @-@ year @-@ old man has a 1 @-@ year history of fevers and a history of waxing and waning erythematous scaly lesions on his arms and legs , pancytopenia , and hyperferritinemia , with a ferritin level of greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter in the peripheral blood .
the markedly elevated ferritin level leads us to consider the diagnosis of HLH syndrome .
in a retrospective review of hyperferritinemia , which was defined by a ferritin level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter , the most common diagnosis in children ( occurring in 49 % of cases ) was HLH .
however , in adults , the most common disorder was hematologic cancer ( occurring in 26 % of cases ) , and HLH was diagnosed in only 14 % of cases.1
in broad terms , the differential diagnosis for this patient 's presentation includes infection , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , DRESS ( drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ) syndrome , and macrophage activation syndrome .
the 1 @-@ year time course would make infection unlikely , the low number of schistocytes on the peripheral @-@ blood smear would make microangiopathic hemolytic anemia unlikely , the lack of exposure to drugs would make DRESS syndrome unlikely , and the absence of a history of autoimmune disease would make classic macrophage activation syndrome unlikely .
HLH is a life @-@ threatening syndrome of hyperactive immune activation that is characterized by high levels of cytokines , which reflect activation of T cells and macrophages ( Figure 3 ) .
in fact , the pathophysiological features of macrophage activation syndrome are very similar to those of HLH , but macrophage activation syndrome manifests in the context of a preexisting rheumatologic disorder .
the triggers for HLH are all associated with dysregulation of the immune system and include immunodeficiency syndromes ( e.g. , the Chédiak @-@ Higashi syndrome or Griscelli 's syndrome ) , rheumatologic disorders , HIV infection , Epstein @-@ Barr virus ( EBV ) infection , and hematologic cancer .
HLH is more common among infants and children than among adults , largely because primary HLH , which denotes the presence of an underlying genetic mutation , typically appears early in childhood on exposure to viral infections .
secondary HLH is triggered by infections that result in hyperactive immune responses .
the distinction between primary and secondary HLH is not always useful , since both are often triggered by infections and both often have underlying genetic mutations that can confer a predisposition to the syndrome .
indeed , this patient meets six of the eight criteria for HLH that were described in a large study of patients with HLH.2,3
the diagnostic criteria include fever ( present in 95 % of patients ) , splenomegaly ( 89 % ) , bicytopenia ( 92 % ) , hypertriglyceridemia or hypofibrinogenemia ( 90 % ) , hemophagocytosis ( 82 % ) , low or absent natural @-@ killer ( NK ) -cell activity ( 71 % ) , elevated soluble CD25 ( interleukin @-@ 2 receptor a chain ) level ( 71 % ) , and a ferritin level greater than 500 ng per milliliter ( 94 % ) .
as is the case in this patient , most of these signs are evident with routine workup of an ill patient , but measurements of NK @-@ cell activity and soluble CD25 are typically performed at reference laboratories as part of the workup of HLH .
the criteria for HLH reflect markers of immune hyperactivation and , in the case of diminished NK @-@ cell activity , ineffective cytolytic pathways ( most likely due to genetic mutations ) .
because adults are less likely than infants and children to have primary HLH and more likely to have an underlying predisposing disease , alternative criteria for the diagnosis of HLH have been defined.4
these criteria include fever , organomegaly , cytopenias , elevated ferritin levels , elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels , the presence of hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow aspirate , and most important , the presence of an underlying predisposing condition , such as a hematologic cancer or infection .
in one study , the predisposing disease was hematologic cancer in 57 % of the patients , and infections were present in 25 % of the patients4 ; similar results were seen in a second study , which showed that , among 162 adult patients with HLH , 56 % had non @-@ Hodgkin 's lymphoma.5
this patient 's disorder meets all the alternative criteria for a diagnosis of HLH , except that the underlying predisposing disease has not yet been elucidated .
hospital Course
Dr. Mark B. Leick : the patient had been healthy until 2 years before admission .
on admission to this hospital , the patient reported ongoing swelling in the legs , forearms , and periorbital area , along with decreased appetite and poor oral intake .
he had a history of coronary artery disease , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , hypothyroidism , and gastroesophageal reflux disease .
he had received a diagnosis of pancytopenia 2 years earlier and had undergone an extensive evaluation 1 year after the diagnosis ; results of serum protein electrophoresis and the serum free light @-@ chain ratio had been normal , and examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow had revealed no evidence of cancer .
medications included pantoprazole , levothyroxine , lisinopril , metoprolol , and aspirin ; treatment with amoxicillin caused nausea , and treatment with simvastatin caused myalgia .
the patient was single and lived alone in a rural area of New England .
he had previously worked in health care but had retired several years before admission .
he smoked three cigars daily and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs .
his father had died from coronary artery disease , and his brother had sarcoidosis and alpha1 @-@ antitrypsin deficiency ; an aunt and uncle had had cancer , but the types were unknown .
on examination , the patient appeared frail .
the temperature was 36.4 ° C , the pulse 93 beats per minute , the blood pressure 119 / 74 mm Hg , the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute , the weight 78.6 kg , and the oxygen saturation 97 % while he was breathing ambient air .
periorbital edema and purpura were seen , along with well @-@ circumscribed erosions and nodules on both legs , with overlying crust in various stages of healing .
the abdomen was soft , with no tenderness or organomegaly .
the ferritin level was 29,600 ng per milliliter .
the soluble CD25 level in the blood was elevated , at 8635 pg per milliliter ( reference range , 532 to 1891 ) .
the blood level of interferon @-@ γ was high ( > 520 pg per milliliter ) .
nucleic acid testing of the blood for EBV DNA was positive , at 1340 IU per milliliter , and nucleic acid testing for human herpesvirus 6 and parvovirus was negative .
an interferon @-@ γ release assay for tuberculosis was negative , and antibodies to herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and to toxoplasma were not detected .
given the finding of periorbital edema , a CT scan of the face , obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material , showed ill @-@ defined areas of increased attenuation along the preseptal soft tissues and within the inferior orbital areas bilaterally , with no signs of a focal drainable collection .
magnetic resonance imaging of the face and orbits was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material .
a T2 @-@ weighted image obtained with short @-@ tau inversion recovery ( STIR ) parameters showed signal hyperintensity within the bilateral preseptal soft tissues , right lateral pterygoid and temporalis muscles with associated signal hyperintensity along the fascial planes of the extraocular muscles , and asymmetric mild enlargement and enhancement of the left superior oblique , medial , and lateral recti .
two days after the patient 's admission to this hospital , fine @-@ needle aspiration biopsy of a fat pad was performed , and pathological examination of the specimen revealed no evidence of malignant cells ; staining with Congo red was negative for amyloid .
results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal , and serum free light chains were not detected .
treatment with oral dexamethasone was initiated .
eight days after the patient 's admission , the ferritin level decreased to 15,846 ng per milliliter ( reference range , 20 to 300 ) , but pancytopenia persisted .
nine days after admission , ruxolitinib was administered .
ruxolitinib , a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor , has shown success in murine models of HLH , with decreased interferon @-@ γ , interleukin @-@ 6 , and interleukin @-@ 12 and decreased symptoms , and has been used successfully in humans .
during the next 7 days , the patient noted increasing energy , decreased edema in the legs , and resolution of fever .
the blood ferritin level further decreased to 2759 ng per milliliter , but pancytopenia and neutropenia persisted 3 weeks after the treatment course with dexamethasone and ruxolitinib had begun .
a repeat bone marrow biopsy was performed .
the marrow was markedly hypocellular ( cellularity < 1 % in the core specimen ) , with patchy serous atrophy ; no hemophagocytic histiocytes were seen .
immunohistochemical examination revealed many scattered T cells and occasional B cells .
treatment with dexamethasone was continued , but ruxolitinib treatment was discontinued .
the day after treatment with ruxolitinib was discontinued , fevers recurred , and the blood ferritin level had increased to 4188 ng per milliliter ; the neutrophil count had not increased .
a diagnostic test was performed , and management decisions were made .
differential Diagnosis of HLH Triggers
Dr. Maus : what triggered this patient 's HLH syndrome ?
a standard workup for hematologic cancer , including imaging studies and bone marrow biopsy , was negative except for an increase in FDG uptake in the spleen , which was slightly enlarged .
there are rare hematologic cancers that are characterized by an absence of lymphadenopathy or bone marrow involvement but may nevertheless trigger HLH .
extranodal LYMPHOMA
approximately 10 to 35 % of patients with non @-@ Hodgkin 's lymphoma present with extranodal disease at the time of diagnosis.6
the most common sites of involvement are the gastrointestinal tract , skin , testes , bones , kidneys , and central nervous system .
however , most extranodal lymphomas also have FDG avidity ; the lymphomas without FDG avidity include chronic lymphocytic leukemia , Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia , marginal @-@ zone lymphoma , and some T @-@ cell lymphomas.7,8
among these non @-@ FDG @-@ avid lymphomas , only splenic marginal @-@ zone lymphoma and T @-@ cell lymphomas typically manifest with extranodal disease .
splenic marginal @-@ zone lymphoma involves the spleen , but the disease is indolent , is associated with autoimmune disease , and rarely causes B symptoms ( i.e. , weight loss , night sweats , and fever ) or acute illness , characteristics that do not fit this patient 's presentation .
therefore , the most likely underlying trigger is a T @-@ cell lymphoma .
T @-@ CELL LYMPHOMA
peripheral T @-@ cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of rare but generally aggressive cancers .
the most common peripheral T @-@ cell lymphoma is a " not otherwise specified " subtype , but multiple subtypes exist , including anaplastic large @-@ cell lymphoma ; angioimmunoblastic T @-@ cell lymphoma ; hepatosplenic T @-@ cell lymphoma ; enteropathy @-@ associated T @-@ cell lymphoma ; extranodal NK T @-@ cell lymphoma , nasal type ; subcutaneous panniculitis @-@ like T @-@ cell lymphoma ; and primary cutaneous gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell lymphoma .
the potential diagnosis of extranodal NK T @-@ cell lymphoma , nasal type , should be considered in this patient because it is an EBV @-@ associated lymphoma that is characterized by germline T @-@ cell @-@ receptor T cells that express CD56 and lack CD8 , with positive staining for EBV @-@ encoded RNA in the tumor cells .
scans obtained in this patient did show abnormal signal intensity in the nasal cavity , and this disease can also involve the skin ; however , the disease typically manifests with a symptomatic midfacial mass .
approximately 3 % of patients who have NK T @-@ cell lymphoma , nasal type , also present with HLH .
however , this subtype of lymphoma typically has FDG avidity on PET , and the patient had neither a symptomatic nasal mass nor clinically significant FDG @-@ avid disease .
one of the patient 's primary symptoms was a scaling erythematous rash on the legs , so cutaneous T @-@ cell lymphoma seems quite likely , despite the rarity of this disease .
subcutaneous panniculitis @-@ like T @-@ cell lymphoma manifests with painless subcutaneous nodules or plaques involving the legs ( occurring in 71 % of patients ) , arms ( 62 % ) , trunk ( 56 % ) , and face ( 25 % ) .9,10
a waxing and waning course is typical , with lesions in various stages of growth and remission .
approximately 20 % of patients have a history of autoimmune disease .
in patients with subcutaneous panniculitis @-@ like T @-@ cell lymphoma , it is unusual for the lymphoma to be present in areas other than the skin , although the bone marrow can harbor hemophagocytes .
pathological examination of skin lesions typically reveals cellular infiltrates composed of T cells and histiocytes in the subcutaneous fat .
the tumorigenic cells associated with subcutaneous panniculitis @-@ like T @-@ cell lymphoma arise from a mature cytotoxic T cell .
the World Health Organization originally characterized the tumorigenic T cells as having clonal rearrangements of either the alpha @-@ beta or the gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell receptor , but subcutaneous panniculitis @-@ like T @-@ cell lymphoma has now been redefined such that the disease is restricted to primary cutaneous T @-@ cell lymphomas that have clonal rearrangements of the alpha @-@ beta T @-@ cell receptor.9
the other immunophenotypic features of subcutaneous panniculitis @-@ like T @-@ cell lymphoma tumors include CD3 + , CD8 + , CD4 − , and CD56 − , as well as positivity for granzyme B , perforin , T @-@ cell receptor alpha @-@ beta , and T @-@ cell intracellular antigen .
the in situ hybridization analysis for EBV @-@ encoded RNA is negative .
approximately 17 % of patients with subcutaneous panniculitis @-@ like T @-@ cell lymphoma present with secondary HLH , and these patients have a worse prognosis than those who do not present with secondary HLH.9
in patients with subcutaneous panniculitis @-@ like T @-@ cell lymphoma , the lesions typically involve only the subcutaneous fat .
the erythematous scaling of the nodules in this patient suggests that his lesions involved the dermis and epidermis and not just the subcutaneous fat .
this characteristic is commonly seen in primary cutaneous gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell lymphoma , which represents less than 1 % of all cases of cutaneous lymphomas .
gamma @-@ delta T cells arise from double @-@ negative thymocytes early in T @-@ cell development and form part of the innate immune system .
unlike alpha @-@ beta T @-@ cell receptors , gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell receptors are not restricted by the HLA ; instead , they recognize lipid antigens or microbial compounds .
gamma @-@ delta T cells make up less than 5 % of circulating lymphocytes but are abundant in the skin and gut .
they may proliferate in response to infections , such as tuberculosis , listeria , and malaria .
in a series of 20 patients with confirmed primary cutaneous gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell lymphoma , 70 % presented with HLH symptoms .
I suspect that in the case of primary cutaneous gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell lymphoma , it is the autonomous T @-@ cell proliferation and aberrant cytokine production that drive the HLH symptomatology , including macrophage activation ( Figure 3 ) .
this disease is very aggressive and portends a poor prognosis , regardless of the presence of HLH symptoms.9
aside from the clonal gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell receptor gene rearrangements , no characteristic mutations in primary cutaneous gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell lymphoma have been defined , although complex cytogenetic features have been reported .
given the combination of the patient 's HLH symptoms and laboratory findings , the absence of lymphadenopathy , and the presence of cutaneous lesions , I favor the diagnosis of primary cutaneous gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell lymphoma manifesting with HLH syndrome .
I would recommend a biopsy of a nodule on the left thigh that would include the subcutaneous fat , and I would perform immunohistochemical testing for CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD56 , and T @-@ cell receptors alpha @-@ beta and gamma @-@ delta , along with T @-@ cell receptor clonality and genetic testing of both the germline and the tumor .
Dr. Marcela V. Maus 's Diagnosis
primary cutaneous gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell lymphoma that triggered hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome .
Dr. Cornejo : a skin biopsy specimen obtained at this hospital from the medial left thigh showed an atypical proliferation of medium @-@ to @-@ large pleomorphic cells in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue that was associated with prominent karyorrhexis ( Figure 4A ) .
mild interface changes of the epidermis with ulceration were also identified .
the infiltrate was angiocentric and angiodestructive ; it surrounded and infiltrated the vessel walls and was associated with fibrin thrombi ( Figure 4B and 4C ) .
there was no evidence of hemophagocytosis .
immunohistochemical stains showed that the neoplastic cells were CD3 + T cells , with retained coexpression of CD2 , and with loss of CD4 , CD8 , and CD5 ( Figure 4D , 4E , and 4F ) .
rare scattered CD20 + B cells were also seen .
the lymphocytes expressed CD56 , as well as cytotoxic proteins granzyme B and perforin ( Figure 4G and 4H ) .
immunohistochemical staining for CD68 identified scattered intermixed histiocytes , and staining for CD30 highlighted rare inflammatory cells .
in situ hybridization was negative for EBV @-@ encoded RNA .
beta F1 ( an antibody for the T @-@ cell beta chain antigen receptor ) and T @-@ cell receptor delta staining were both positive in the atypical lymphocytes ( Figure 4I and 4J ) .
molecular studies showed the presence of a clonal T @-@ cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangement .
the morphologic features and immunophenotype in conjunction with the molecular findings were consistent with primary cutaneous gamma @-@ delta T @-@ cell lymphoma .
coexpression of beta F1 and T @-@ cell receptor delta on immunohistochemical testing has been previously reported.11
discussion of Treatment
Dr. Leick : because the patient 's malignant T cells expressed low levels of CD30 , treatment with cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , dexamethasone , and brentuximab vedotin was initiated .
this regimen was administered , rather than the standard cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and dexamethasone ( CHOP ) regimen , given emerging evidence that suggests the superiority of this regimen in peripheral T @-@ cell lymphomas expressing CD30.12
four days after the initiation of chemotherapy , the patient 's cutaneous lymphomatous lesions were less indurated .
however , the next day , rapidly progressive respiratory failure developed , which resulted in intubation , initiation of pressors , and transfer to the intensive care unit .
the most likely diagnosis was diffuse alveolar hemorrhage , given that , at the time of intubation , the patient had had epistaxis and clots were removed from his trachea .
a bronchoscopy was negative .
other possible diagnoses included volume overload ( volume overloaded , with multifocal interstitial opacities ) , and aspiration pneumonia .
subsequently , the patient was noted to have fixed and dilated pupils ; an urgent CT scan of the head showed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left cerebellar hemisphere with mass effect on the brain stem and fourth ventricle , as well as transtentorial and tonsillar herniation .
in consultation with the patient 's brother and sister @-@ in @-@ law , comfort measures were initiated , and the patient died peacefully on hospital day 57 .
after the patient 's death , a familial HLH germline genetic analysis performed at Cincinnati Children 's Hospital was negative for germline mutations .
however , targeted gene sequencing of the patient 's skin biopsy specimen for hematologic cancers revealed a nonsense mutation with a 34.6 % allele frequency in TNFAIP3 ( the gene encoding NF @-@ kB negative regulator A20 ) that was predicted to be a pathogenic variant ( TNFAIP3 ENST00000237289.4 : c.1694C ← A , ENSP00000237289.4 : p.Ser565Ter ) .
recent testing of the patient 's bone marrow specimen in which the same gene sequencing panel was used had been negative .
therefore , the patient was believed to have a tumor @-@ specific mutation .
dysfunction of TNFAIP3 has been associated with autoinflammatory disease in humans and increased production of interferon @-@ γ and tumor necrosis factor a by T cells during in vitro stimulation.13,14
