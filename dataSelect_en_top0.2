That was very interesting.
My characters drove cars.

So, how about "humanist"?
Thank you very much.

Nobody thinks there's opportunity.
Thank you very much.
Almost nothing has changed.

They've come to stay?
They find it here.
And he says, "No."
And he was right.
He started demanding it.
It's rooted in extraction.
Could we reinvent fire?
They've created our wealth.
So it needs refurbishment.
It's fallen by half.
That doesn't interest me.
Fantastic! It's a beauty!
It's better, but nobody.
"Yes, General. Yes, General."
And they hate him.
That's when language begins.
They never did anything.
"It's okay, it's okay."
Thank you very much.
Companies are losing control.
But are they really?
This is Revolution 2.0.
Everyone has done something.
Everything was going bad.
Everything was going wrong.
Yet, nothing was happening.
There was no leader.
But they detained me.
And I went out.
And those distributions grow.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Fabian Oefner: Psychedelic science
Compassion has many faces.
They are not luxuries.
She had phenomenal strength.
This is called resilience.
That's how they're created.
But check this out.
Now check this out.
Thank you very much.
"Ah ha! American, great."
You've all done it.
Let's play a game.
Now where's the lady?
Where is the queen?

That's "Clair de Lune."
Guess what. They don't.
We're in constant motion.
Our cells experience that.
Let me show you.
Plug and play. Easy.
Personalized medicine. Thank you.
This means, "I'm smiling."
Here's where it happens.
That's because she dances.
"I'm laughing out loud."
She also embraced violence.
That's just one example.
And it's an accident.
And it's getting worse.
They've made a selection.
That's because it's cheaper.
Thank you very much.

Touch is even better.
So this is true.
Well, here's my suggestion.
This is the drawing.
Their answer was interesting.
Thank you very much.
Why does this happen?
He closes his eyes.
"OK, open your eyes."
He said, "It's gone."
So, that's the bonus.
Why does this happen?
Why does this happen?
Why would that be?
So far, so good.
Ninety-nine percent of you.
That's a wasps' nest.
This is his sister.
It's a geometric language.
Take the cherries too.
Thank you very much.
It's an extraordinary thing.

Thank you very much.
Your call. Your call.
Yes, it's happening here.
No one believed them.
They're keeping you alive.
Can you hear that?
Digital scrotum, digital media.
So fun is defendable.
Why is this happening?
It's like the air.
I'm a digital immigrant.
Now, what is openness?
He viewed talent differently.
Openness is about collaboration.

Why does this matter?
Own your own success."
This is the complication.
She starts leaning back.
They're just not moving.
They showed bloody gums.
It's an amazing notion.
Except, maybe we do.
They're packed with information.
And then, what's next?
Thank you very much.
Put that in play.
Thank you very much.
It's, like, amazing, right?
You feel for them.
It's peaceful, like that.
And also "no love."
So that is authoritarianism.
That's a little scary.
And it's very powerful.
SB: What is it?
Here it's slightly logged.
Do we have any?
Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.
Important? Not so very.
So why design thinking?
What's the design brief?
Thank you very much.
And I can't decide.

Thank you very much.
What's next for us?
Thank you very much.

Here's their marketing video.
And they fake it.
There was women's liberation.
Side street in Italy.
Curves against sharp things.
Thank you very much.
And I said, "Why?"
So I chose furniture.
But not office chairs.
And I flew it.
No arms at all.
And breathability is good.
So here we are.
This is Aedes aegypti.
That's two days ago.
It's just not practical.
It's just the female.
And what's the result?
Thank you very much.
"Why now?" "Why here?"
Genetics, lifestyle and environment.
Anybody? Boy you're lucky.
Oh, not so lucky.
Now follow me, OK?
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.

Why phosphorus in particular?
It's an extraordinary change.
Let's start with this.
Weather patterns have changed.
Some dry up altogether.
So thanks very much.

Please welcome Amanda Kitts.
AK: It works good.
TK: A little faster?
It's like 96 percent.
TK: Thank you, Amanda.
Takes about a minute.
Turbo's never been fed.
So this is Turbo.
Again, globalization Chinese style.
Then there is trade.
Now it encourages it.
Let's start with Iraq.
No. It's the pipelines.
She says, "I'm 60."
So it's really interesting.
CK: Yes, that's right.
It's more like that.
Political parties: oh boy.
Mosquitos. I hate them.
But that's fascinating, right?

So watch this kangaroo.
Okay, there it goes.
And show the video.
Stay tuned for that.
That changes our climate.
It's the ANDRILL project.
This was completely unexpected.
And you know what?
Here's a synthetic diagram.
Thank you very much.
That's great. That's great.
And it was incredible.
And it was revolting.
And that's my wish.
Thank you very much.
"What are you reading?"
That's your new normal.
That's the honest truth.
So what has changed?
My brain started thinking.
Every species does it.
This is for children.
So back to economics.
Well, a poor understanding.
That's basically the difference.
So models can change.
This is not uncommon.
Think about seat belts.
It's complete security theater.
And that's already happening.
And we're almost there.
Thank you very much.
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.
Would look at it.
They were doing fine.
But she ate it.
Thank you so much.
So they elevated it.
They need political solutions.

Because we didn't talk.
This is Tahrir Square.
That's not the point.
Sometimes you have to.

They don't have them.
That's it, thank you.
It's you; you're broken.
But here's the rub.
Actually, no, I'm not.
This is their lobby.
So, they were bored.
Thank you very much.
Compassion is also curious.
This is Jean Vanier.
Well, he was complicated.
So was Mother Teresa.
So are we all.
That's our cultural inheritance.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Where are we today?
Thank you very much.
And he said, "No."
And he said, "No.
You're not a duck.
It's just not true.
That's what he prays.
What's in your hand?
It's a shepherd's staff."
What's in your hand?"
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.
That's when he falls.
Beth Israel's in Boston.
This is Van Quach.

They're exotic. They're experimental.
They say it's denial.
You want to do.
Days before he died.
It's not a bug.
Hope isn't a bug.
There's lots of possibilities.
Here's the key question.
That's not too good.
Thank you very much.
That's in his autobiography.
That's an interesting idea."
Thank you very much.
Just think about it.
Just think about it.
Let's start with technology.
Well, a few things.
Let's start with technology.
This has been fantastic.
Enjoying it so far?
It's an amazing picture.
Why is everyone crying?"
So anyway, I left.
This is her half-sister.
That match was unambiguous.
Now, the good news.
It's a new telescope.
That's great news. Why?
But it's really tiny.
Let's actually try that.
Let me try it.
This is not insignificant.
This is very significant.
And let's do it.
Thank you very much.
Now, what has happened?
So, ready, steady, go!
So, is it poverty?
And what is concurrency?
Thank you very much.
Let's talk about billions.
Let's talk about billions.
That's a great question.
Two, the scientific revolution.
Five, the consumer society.
That's another killer app.
Finally, the work ethic.
That's how scytodes forages.
That's just the best.
It's actually quite entertaining.
Right? Bad hire. Right?
Pro-ana, the pro-ana groups.
Thank you very much.
And then, stage nine.
O.K.? Radical, not subtle.
I'd call that radical.
Okay, I wrote that.
My son is 23.
Boy: How about this?
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.
Boy: It's lighting up.
Nothing really interesting, basically.
Now, here's another one.
You can burst bubbles.
You don't like it?
But they're playing geopolitics.
Thank you very much.
Say your motorcycle crashes.
You won't believe me.
Correct "dissuade". "Not just."
Cocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.
So, back to Mars.
It's bursting with life.
And that electron disappears.
And we found three.
And I was outraged.
It's in the smell.
Let's think about probability.
Third, you reward effort.
Let's start with business.
Thank you very much.
Now, something else happened.
That's an enormous benefit.
It's baleen. Moving on.
An 81-year-old itinerant farmer.
Another example is "slash."
Thank you very much.
Golan Levin: Software art
There was amazing improvements.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
They asked this question.
We're losing a ritual.
She says, "I did."
Rituals are terribly important.
They're all about transformation.
Thank you very much.
Now open your eyes.
Unfortunately I couldn't go.
They make balloon animals.
You don't need everyone.
That's next to impossible.
However, there's a catch.
Radiant, as in self-sustaining.
It's willful. It's intentional.
It's focus and presence.
This is La Scala.
It's smaller than this.
This is Carnegie Hall.
This is Chet Baker.
Thank you very much.
Now, what causes this?
But death is inevitable.
I've talked to them.
Was there a God?
He was a liar.
Or he was insane.
Everyone can be wrong.
This is "Break Clustered."
Our boys' deaths galvanize.
Bitches get beat daily.
Profits made, prophets ignored.
Sickness, health, tender violence.
Girl spoiled before ripened.
Language can't math me.
My spine curves spiral.
Cluster bombs left behind.

And this changes gradually.
But homage to Singapore.
It's about having food.
Getting out of poverty.
You can do this.
Bring me my sword!
So I showed him.
I'll call it score.
They were changing shape.
And he obliged us.
It's not orally available.
It's funded by foundations.
You've heard of entropy.
So that's our job.
It's very, very unlikely.
That's my favorite scenario.
That's all. Thank you.
This is incredible, really.
Thank you so much.
Bird: This is incredible.
Osorio: Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.
This is live transmission.
Waste collection on time.
Thank you very much.
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?
But here's the deal.
Actually, most of them.
Everybody's got an opinion.
That's the scary part.
You need the experience.
We're done with that.
Here's the larger point.
Armor goes this way.
Trigger-pullers go this way.
Return to the Army.
There's the grandstand now.
Thank you very much.
Tell me about you."
This picture is incredible.
They broke her bangles.
Had I heard right?
But Sakena defies labels.
Then things get tense.
They have to negotiate.
Beam me up, Scotty.
It's something terrible, horrible.
Thank you. Thank you.
Some did, not everybody.
But he wasn't dismayed.
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore.
Even that wasn't enough.
It's the spirit inside."
And they have humility.
"How come?" said Kartikeya.
'My world' is subjective.
It's emotional. It's personal.
And they both laughed.
That's what he heard.
It's always about taste.
But first, my disclosures.
I'm not a radiologist.
So here's an example.
MBI found 83 percent.
First, know your density.
Of course we should.
We're the new technologists.
Let's take an example.
Which one is it?
You're safe. It's fine.
That's a stunning vision.
He wants objective truths.
But don't give up.
Let's take an example.
There's not a formula.
Do it over lunch.
This is our movie.
He named it homunculus.
It's you. It's me.
It's our invisible reality.
Marketing creates user groups.
This is white noise.
It's too in silence.
So, definitely not perfect.
So, a huge problem.
Or you start fishing.
See, like this one?
Just for my workshop.
Thank you very much.
Mathieu Lehanneur: Science-inspired design
You couldn't sell cocaine.
Now, Sudhir was lucky.
They are the entrepreneurs.
OK, just like McDonald's.
Here's an economic principle.
It's exactly this concept.
Thank you very much.
And I believe soon.
Coming off of you?
"What does it matter?"
It's about being together.
I'm the short one.
EW: The full monty.

And everybody's crying now.
They said, "Syria?" "Syria."
It's everybody." The Chinese.
Something crazy also happened.
This is the enemy.
And you become friends.
Just raise that. Exactly.
Copenhagen, Shanghai, modern, European.
You can try it.
This is my apartment.
They accumulate the water.
Likewise in communicable diseases.
I'm all for that.
Of course they would.
Thank you very much.
Now this does matter.
I'll figure something out.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
SL: Yes, it is.
Here are a few.
Their calculations are different.
Leslie Chang: One minute?
Thank you very much.
And then this happened.
So who's using it?
This is a lamp.
Businesses want different things.
Do you hate Americans?
They use his rhetoric.
So, that's a breakthrough.
Those shapes are parabolas.
Those were major breakthroughs.
That's a heat engine.
Thank you very much.
You don't even know.
Well, not so awful.
Do you have that?
Encouraging telecommuting? What works?
So are we ready?
Otherwise you're in trouble.
So we built something.
But here I am.
And he was frowning.
You know that, right?
Thank you. Thank you.
But he seemed nervous.
Thank you. Thank you.
They were very enthusiastic.
Thank you very much.
You need voting logic.
There's a just-unbelievable diversity.
Diver 2 : Hoo!
He died in 1974.
Perspectives can be altered.
Alright, one billion stars.
Well, what about 10^22?
That's called a profit.
Girl 2: Uh, yeah.
Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!
This is Hermann Goering.
Now nobody believed him.
Why does this matter?
Would you eat this?
That's not so surprising.
And here's another example.
That's a technical term.
But that's not enough.
Thank you very much.
And I say, "Empathy.
Does this sound familiar?
You can't expect that."
That's the warm up.
That's what you want.
You read about it.
You talk about it.
But there's something else.
Whatever. I don't know."
You don't know that.
You're generalizing. It's wrong.
She's anybody to me.
Can you go there?
Can you imagine that?
Can you go there?
You see, that's empathy.
Well, more idea creators.
1900s: maybe one percent.
That's not that far.
Alright what about problems?
So what actually happened?
Well, commercial hunting happened.
It's called an allele.
I've got a question.
And he wandered away.
And a video camera.
And I meet Bagheads.
Old-fashioned classrooms suffer too.
Let's start with technology.
There is a revolution.
It's motion and emotion.
Thank you very much.
And they said, "Yeah!"
Thank you so much.
So what's going on?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Thank you very much.
That's the bad news.
Now that is foreplay.
That's the profound switch.
That's a geranium pollen.
Janine Benyus: Oh really?
That's the twelfth one.
So I was amazed.
But think about this.
Most people say women.
Thank you very much.
And that's Studs Terkel.
"OK. OK? OK. OK.
Thank you so much.
And I'm on this.
Nothing seemed to help.
Married, single, unattached hiccupper.
They didn't buy it.
This is the 1950s.
This one involves men.
And the happy result.
Thank you very much.
But not to worry.
Live long and prosper.
Thank you very much.
That's what he said.
We're five now. Five.
You'll never walk again."
And maybe he had.
He listened to me.
Okay. So I'm smiling.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, it's so sad.
It's changed my life.
Isn't there something shorter?
So here I was.
It's a huge list.
Thank you very much.
Now this was revolutionary.
What's pushing on it?
This number is small.
So, what to do?
Mystery solved, multiverse found.
Thank you very much.
So let's move forward.
We're actually teaching him.
Try hitting the boat.
Milo: Ahhh. So close.
They're always getting stressed.
Thank you very much.
This is a brain.
Okay, most of you.
She lives in Ethiopia.
There's Bill Easterly's book.
He sort of mumbled.
She never broke down.
So, here's the cause.
Thank you very much.
They will completely lose.
And there's no adaption.
Thank you very much.
They flip the negative.
It's titled "The Innocents."
That's it. Thank you.
So I started sketching.
It's actually pretty busy.
Well, we certainly try.
We're also born pleasure-seekers.
But it's not irrelevant.
We're talking '95 now.
Because, aren't they vermin?
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.
So, to standardize this.
Thank you very much.
Be water, my friend.
This is my art.
Where has it been?
We've done the research.
And they're just passed.
Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh.
Cellulite here, cellulite here.
That's all stem cells.
We're bending the curve.
And women do fundraising.
Nanny: You want water?
It's not one way.
Can you do it?
Can you do it?
DR: Ma, he's walking.
It's the "what" detector.
It's the selective logic.
Secondly, making them interactive.
Thank you very much.
It's a two-person tub.
Then, another bathroom upstairs.
So we hired on.
Second, security. Third, relationships.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
But this is hypothesis-generating.
She was a crystallographer.
From nothing to thing.
So case closed, right?
"And come in shackles?
Even the guards cried.
He's even here today.
This disease was terrifying.
This is the picture.
There's absolutely no question.
Umar also has polio.
It's simply not sustainable.
And that's Richard Feynman.
Thank you very much.
Back to you, Henry.
HE: Thank you, Chad.
Actually, that's not true.
Thank you very much.
And it's terribly endangered.
It's all right there.
It's getting more connected.
You need a guide.
Basically, she's a deejay.
Since then, what's happened?
Should I try it?
You've won a prize!
She's like, "It's not?
But you know what?
So they did that.
So let me see.
Now don't be shy.
It's just a robot.
Ready for some jokes?
That's all for now.
Thank you very much.
Heather Knight: Silicon-based comedy
"Don't talk to strangers."
Let me introduce him.
Indeed, it's rather small.
Of course he knew.
And it's totally overkill.
And Jackson Pollock also.
This is Richard Serra.
This is a pipe.
Thank you very much.
This may be surprising.
But it diminishes considerably.
You're watching a video.
It's something very different.
That's not the idea.
Then you take off.
You sit there, OK.
That was my journey.
This isn't easy stuff.
That's understandable and important.
And indeed they had.
She said, "What's that?"
"You can exchange groups.
You can't catch me.
It's pretty simple stuff.
You don't question that.
That's what moves you.
Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.
Looking for business, governor?
Sebastian: Draw thy sword.
It's real, what's happening.
And no hiking boots.
Thank you very much.
Jacqueline Novogratz: Patient capitalism
50-million-plus views on YouTube.
Thank you very much.
Let me start again.
And they're scientific models?
OK, here we go.
I've got no plans."
It's natural. It's everywhere.
It's over two billion.
You think that's big.
It's an absolute brute.
They found another megaprime."
You think that's cool.
It's beyond our reach."
This cancer is remarkable.
Take marriage for example.
And I'm not alone.
So they felt worse.
So why is that?
Anticipation made them happy.
History is not linear.
It's all very one-dimensional.
Wars persist. Power persists.
Military power is important.
Keeping balances is important.
Thank you very much.
So those three actors.
Now, that is difficult.
Let's talk about manias.
Manias can be good.
Manias can be alarming.
Teacher: Perfect! Students: Perfect!
T: Perfect! S: Perfect!
Thank you very much.
They're just inherited mores.
They would say wolves.
It's a true feeling.
You know the one.
You know that teacher?
I'm not here alone.
That's a breach there.
She read two sentences.
But it's self-evident assessment.
Will you accept it?"
Put this on top.
This makes an igloo.
This is one-way traffic.
It's like a centrifuge.
There are four pictures.
This is a straw.
Wool sticks on Velcro.
So that's a ship.
Thank you so much.
It's a high-strength polymer.
I've cracked the code.
Now, your matzoh balls.
But let's be frank.
That's our target shape.
Try changing it again.
They're called cellular automata.

Why is Cargill important?
It's a pre-competitive issue.
"Why don't you try?"
Me too, every day.
Can you believe that?
Please welcome Claron McFadden.
And there's different text.
Example number two: Wikipedia.
Right. Dumbest idea ever.
I'm not taking sides.
Totally mortifying to him.
It's a brilliant idea.
Those things really exist.
Just see the contrast.
That leads to productivity.
"Poor people are recipients."
I've been very surprised.
"Poor countries need aid."
It's just an experiment.
There they are today.
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.
He's also our brother.

Arthur Ganson: Moving sculpture
It's cool for me.
Thank you very much.
I'm a qualitative researcher.
That was my mantra.
They believe they're worthy.
You cannot selectively numb.
There's no discourse anymore.
That's not our job.
Wait, poor spinal capacity.
But I want more.
And here's another paper.
Because something went different.
And I am thankful.
But this is different.
Where are economic networks?
You get the idea.
It's a natural antibiotic.
So what's going on?

Thank you very much.
And I said, Never.
It's the forever-always-on museum.
And there RISD appeared.
So, thank you everyone.
And so we should.

No. It's about us.
Bob Mankoff: "Oooh, no.
Oooh. Hmm. Too funny.

They work extraordinarily well.
And 100 pages later.
You see the idea?
If, if, if, then.
SB: No, not without.
You can't stop it.
Ah, yes, there is.
Stick with the definition.
Audience: SB: Mmm mmm.
But that's not all.
And we're getting there.
What's going to happen?
Because we are self-replicating.
It's easy to bend.
No bill ever disappeared.
Here is what happens.
Here is the thing.
Of course they would.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
That's how we met.
DL: With one minute.
NM: With one minute.
Let's get her going.
NM: Not too fast.
DL: What about Leahy?
I'm sick of it.

It's found 31 workers.
They're from multiple agencies.
Let's make it personal.
Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh.
It's a medium-sized nucleus.
Anyone heard of it?
And the transformation continues.
And yeah, we're there.
You could inform legislation.
That's still true today.
It's beautiful, isn't it.
Sometimes we just forget.
You were born to.
Thank you. Thank you.
It's partly the look.
That's what we do.
1.1 million of them.

And this influenced me.
"Do you have tenure?"
Well, here's a diagnosis.
Thank you very much.
"Great -- got it."
And Albert's like, "What?"
He's like, "A day."
Just bite 'em off."
That's peripety or peripeteia.
No, I mean really.
It's a civil war.
That's what TV does.
And I've got malingering.
They're called the CCHR.
And I said, "How?"
And he sat down.
I'm not mentally ill."
He was a psychopath.
And they didn't reply.
So I changed tack.
And I said, "Manipulative."
He said, "That's leadership."
So I said okay.
Everyone's a bit psychopathic."
That's an academic question.
Enough of all that.
Thank you very much.
Go and study it."
That's what I do.
But it's not gone.
I've done some tests.
That's not the point."
And I love information.
And there's Dan Etete.
He used shell companies.
And here's the thing.
Thank you very much.
And I'm already off-message.
And they deserve better.
So there you are.
Well, they used it.
And I was thrilled.
Don't get me started.
Which really bothers me.
Thank you. Thank you.
This is Lincoln Meadow.
Thank you for listening.
That was much better.
He's out of time.
So, my closing thought.

Who's got the apple?
Student 3: 0.99 seconds.
Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!
We've done that already."
That's what we do.
So here we are.
And I said, "Yeah."
So I said, "Yes."
Bad zoning, but ..."
And I said, "Yes."
And I said, "Yes."
And I said, "..."
"That is exactly right.
Would that ever happen?"
That would never happen."
I'm a process engineer.
Happy, away I went.
It's treated with insecticides.
Would we do that?
And that might work.
Thank you so much.
And what happens next?

They're very little understood.
And here's a male.

It's not so simple.
This is the land.
You try things out.
Lucia angel, okay, eye.
Audience: Saw many trains.
Now, where is it?
It's a horrible situation.
Now, that's one barrier.
Thank you very much.
That sounds complicated, right?
That's me getting mica.
But this is it.
This is deeply democratizing.
Thank you very much.
Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.
This weighs 6.9 pounds.

Well there's good reasons.
Thank you very much.
Very, very interesting planet.
This is Olympus Mons.
Why is methane important?
There aren't many craters.
We're ready to go.
Thank you very much.
This is my house.
Let me be clear.
Why should we care?
And this is climate-proof.
Families need the help.
Because this is wrong.
And that's about it.
It's never been shown.
Thank you very much.
And I'm living proof.
No blue, no green.
Mars comes to mind.
One-way trips are easy.
That's another great idea.

Every neuron is different.
It's the first view.

So, thanks to him.
This is the patent.
It's a spring-operated device.
It's getting more systematic.
That's an important improvement.
Which one seems longer?
No, right? It's impossible.
Turns out they're identical.
Now you're getting it.
Thank you very much.
Then there's ultraviolet light.
But not only that.
It's illuminating the space.

Barry Schuler: Genomics 101
Dogs get so abused.

They trust their ears.
So T is F.

Something I truly believe.
We're all one family.
It's actually surprisingly simple.
It's not even new.
It's an amazing experience.
That's walking Abraham's path.
Thank you very much.
You have six months.
That was our task.
That's our average budget.
We've never found that.
Okay? We're feeding seniors.
And that's just great.
Except what about locally?
From young, smart developers.
Does anybody remember these?
This costs, anybody guess?
So, thanks very much.
That's what it is.
And yet we count.
And that's the rollout.
And I said, "Great."
And everybody was quiet.
And here's the result.
How, you may ask?
Thank you so much.
Very, very high resolution.
Thank you very much.
They've never been dived."
And I said, "Yeah.
It's an interesting fact.

["The 99"] Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Let's take a look.
Let's take a look.
Let's have a look.
Of course, 2.1 million.
There's always conflicting evidence.
So it spawns itself.
It's kind of living.
It's not really true.
Thank you very much.
That's Europe." But, yeah.
They are more dynamic.
Perhaps a stealth thing.
They found themselves pregnant.
But I am angry.
Here's what we know.
That's a longer story.
Now, you take pre-kindergarten.
Maybe July, maybe June.

Which is America's Jupiter?

And they never will.
Twenty-two godchildren I've got.
"Our Lady in White."
This could be us.

So, the water bottle.
Cars are all wrong.
It's made from Kevlar.
Thank you very much.
It's a magical place.
It's an open-source project.

And then this happened.
That's the first thing.
This is a moose.
It's remarkable: the position.
It's Justin Bieber's "Baby."
Let's go to schools.
They don't understand us.
Michael's a young guy.
He won the appeal.

Here we go. OK.
This is the ultimate.
Let me zoom in.
It's a female now.
And I said, "Really?
Because isn't that easy?
And here's the result.
Too hot, too hot.
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency.
This is very practical.
Political, economic, psychological, whatever.
Band Aid, Live Aid.
Well, why aren't we?
But think about it.
Momentum has been building.
There's the continent Africa.
Okay, my three wishes.
Anyway, here's number one.
This might look familiar.
Sadly, it's metaphorically true.
Thank you very much.
Your father is murdered.
Brought in more women.
Brought in younger men.
And this is true.
My father was assassinated.
We've created the credibility.
And that's not fair.
I'm not so old.
PM: Yes, you are.
PM: "Shake the Dust."
Crazy, I know. Insane.
This meant making trade-offs.

We're facing this problem.
There is the problem."
This is my daughter.
So here's a bear.

And that's really exciting.
And I was fascinated.
They are called neurons.
Question for you, Kwabena.
It's way more energetic.
And that's the fun.
Ah, wicked, cruel fate!
Thank you very much.
Wow, a volunteer, yay!
Nice to meet you.
We're a social species.
Suddenly, here we are.
Why would someone bother?
Now, this is big.
Our future is many-to-many.
Schools can't be silos.
That changes everything, right?
There's a self-help group.
Thank you very much.
Thanks for having me.
Of course we don't.
Everyone needs a coach.
That's how we improve.
I'm talking about teachers.
Our teachers deserve better.
Eleven out of 14.
I'll see you later.
Why not personal biotech?
But you know what?
But awareness needs action.

That's the Lucifer effect.
Fifty-year-old African-American construction worker.
He's actually here today.
My mom says, "patriarchy."
It's called thought-controlled computing.
And that was responsiveness.
This is for real.
This technology is intra-active.
No special needs schools.
And that door closed.
And my chest ached.
He said, "Be you."
There's just too much.
Thank you very much.
It's really, really tiring.
It's an interesting question.
Thank you very much.

This is a disaster.
Thank you very much.

He's very shy, too.
Where'd that come from?
But there were problems.
And yet, we began.
This is the challenge.
That's not that hard.
That has to stop.
This can be done.
It's about energy emissions.
Well I'm afraid not.
He loved intellectual battle.
He loved to win.
Feynman loved this story.
They were so happy.
And he was curious.
So, well he did.
There was a theory.
So, playing with fire.
So those are great.
It's very safe actually.
Thank you very much.
And it's working beautifully.
Aren't they? Aren't they?
They're suffering from childhood.
Great leaders know that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
So that's for fun.
It's all about connections.
Hasn't changed that much.
Getting it over there?
Yeah, there you go.
Thank you once again.
Appreciate it very much.
Let's play a little.
But something weird happened.
And puzzling it is.
"What does it say?"
So here's some examples.
Why is that happening?
That's kind of bad.
Because meetings aren't work.
But meetings also procreate.
Just silence, that's it.
Just don't have it.
So thanks for listening.
OK, that's fair enough.
This one I love.
I'm just the messenger.
It's called a lobotomy.
Text: Relpy to all.
This is my tattoo.
And we practice holism.
They're beautiful. They're bamboo.
There's nowhere to flush.
There isn't enough water.
It's becoming a community.
There are no sidewalks.
You learn bamboo building.
And we were right.
It's a double helix.
Does anybody remember that?"
But no you don't.
Did design do this?
And who's responsible? Designers.
Give power to designers.

You learn things unconsciously.
So close your eyes.

You are now immortal.
They were very conscious.
Thank you very much.
Edward Tenner: Unintended consequences
Just type over it.
Have a great day.
And that's BumpTop. Thanks!
What's your act two?
And I said, "Oh."
Wouldn't that be handy?
This is just theoretical.
JS: Okay. Wet hands.
Roundabouts are much better.
But that's just safety.
What's that time worth?
That would not work.
Drew Dudley: Everyday leadership
Nothing will be specific.
There's no specificity there.
And Roger helped me.
So here's a tumor.
Thank you very much.
Quyen Nguyen: Color-coded surgery
Why does this matter?
Let's make it concrete.
Ed Boyden: That's right.
No, that's not true.
I'll go very quickly.
So far so good?
Just shout it out.
Live life. Thank you.
This is a bird.
That was one sentence.
They become building steel.
That's the Pacific Gyre.
This is the site.
This is their plan.
They've changed the world.
Right? It's pretty big.
But now we do.
Instead, they've been hacked.
And maybe that's true.
And surveillance changes history.
That's what it's about.
Thank you very much.
Let's look at neurons.
And remember, it's frozen.
And we get confirmation.
So why is that?
There's only one Africa.
So let's try them.
So what's the best?
So, why is that?
There's no silver bullet.
And that's very frustrating.
This was 300 BC.
Fast forward to 2002.
Let's start unpacking it.
What's going on there?
Thank you very much.
OK, reverse your hands.
KT: How are you?
KB: Are you ready?
KT: Oh, my God!
KB: Sure there's not?
KB: And I've stopped.
KT: That is weird.
Can you come up?
Yes, at the end.
OK, keep it there.

Was that his name?
There you are, OK.

SJ: Yes, there's one.
KB: Neither, oh, OK.
Psychologists, figure this out.
Keith Barry: Brain magic
So I started smaller.
And we have testosterone.
Her mother, that's right.
Or should they not?
And I went away.
So I started publishing.
Where does it stop?
So I tested them.
Because it was needed.
You can't catch me.
So what's my wish?
Thank you. Thank you.
So it's more disordered.
Her name is Zumra.
Snares on, snares off.
Just the basic feeling.

It's bird-like and hollow.
That's a big skull.
They're really kindred disciplines.
Thank you very much.
She's under the underdogs.
So what's the connection?

He's very bad, Leo.
He's a scary monster.
Boards don't hit back.

Thank you. Thank you.
But oh, her soap!
It's a longer poem.
It's called "The Neighbor."
My holding the door.
This is called "Thirst."
But forget her breasts.
It's a special feeling.
That's pretty much it.
Thank you very much.
None of those happened.
Fears also have suspense.
That's clearly not true.
That's the real thing.
That's what was missing.
That's another story, perhaps.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
"People do stupid things.
That's what spreads HIV."
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.
It's not that easy!
No one wants it.

Let's have the banjo.
This is Ralph Stanley.
Ain't that a sound?
Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.
It's called the sunga'.
It's great. It's fantastic.
And there he is.
No, no, ahh ...
"Christian principles, Christian values.
Sorry, what? "A nu-ca-ler."
Thank you very much.
And I, you know."
Lots of different kinds.
Now think about that.
So this was interesting.
It's inflating very fast.
And that's pretty cool.
It's a big skull.
So Torosaurus is extinct.
Again, makes you wonder.
Thank you very much.
Jack Horner: Shape-shifting dinosaurs
Also the visual separation.
Thank you very much.
Wired magazine, November 2010.
Pam from The Office.
Why is this important?
Now there are 192.
So inertia versus momentum.
This is exciting stuff.
Thank you so much.
But shipping isn't that.
Ships have automation now.
They're no good either.
That's really not affordable.
What's on your mind?
So, it actually works.
But not so fast.
And they prevent disaster.
Now, how about incentives?
One: Celebrate moral exemplars.
There are ordinary heroes.
Someone is always watching.
That's the principle objective.
Obama appealed to virtue.

And it looks delicious.
Ah, isn't that cool?
So, this is CLIMBeR.

So we walked around .
So we get this .
And we practice holism .
Because we lived scattered .
So we collect this MR.
And we get confirmation .
Sometimes we spread out .
And we &apos;re vulnerable .
So we got started .
Do we stop there ?
Sometimes we just forget .
And we don &apos;t .
So we &apos;re thrilled .
And we &apos;re miserable .
So we built something .
Could we reinvent fire ?
And we &apos;re here .
But we failed him .
And we &apos;re alive .
And after that, we succeeded.
Oh, after you stopped paying.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
Because our time is up.
I accept where we are.
Bharat also conquered the world.

That's all I'd ever known.

They died of massive infection.
Okay, almost all of you.
And here are some excerpts.
We started with two schools.
Very good . Okay .
A lot of change .
A lot of hurdles .
A lot of it .
What does the data say?
I saw forests and meadows.
So I will do this.
I saw layers of security.
I feel a little uncomfortable.
I wanted a better education.
I saw it firsthand .
I feel so fortunate .

First independent newspaper in Slovakia.
What would it look like?
What would they have seen?
What would they tell us?
What would you tell them?"
What would that tell us?
What would it look like?
What would this lead to?
What would you do today?
What would you guess ?
What would you say ?
What would that mean ?
What would you say ?
What would it be ?
What would you do ?
What would I love ?
What would you do ?
Are there camels in Hamburg?"
People there love this .
Are there universal laws ?
We should pull it forward.
Why should we care ?
And should we care ?
Why should we care ?
We'll use biofuels. Problem solved.
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
They use his rhetoric .
Always use remote control .
Others use psychedelic drugs .
You use sign language .
How can we address them?"
How can we know this?
How can we do it?
It can even change you.
How can we help you?
How can we do that?
We can save that one.
We can inspire each other.
We can calculate the aspect.
We can get productivity up.
We can get efficiency up.
We can design better games.
We can heal the disease.
We can harness those benefits.
We can capture that information.
We can go much further.
We can fly around them.
We can choose otherwise .
We can go further .
We can hug both .
We can &apos;t scale .
We can &apos;t scale .
We can see them .
He has to have poise.

And I have a dream.
Do I have rights ?
I remember it clearly .
It might make a sound.
A massive cardiac arrest .
We found this last year.
We found marsupial lions .
We found carnivorous kangaroos .
Maybe no one's really crazy.
That's no sacrifice, that's revenge!
There's no feeling about germs.
So no wilderness, no revelations.
There's no real emergence there.
There's no breeding pairs left.
There's no rocket science here.
There's no competition at all.
There's no comparison at all.
There's no ice over it.
Basically, no one's very happy.
Because no one's really watching.
So no ego problems .
And no hiking boots .
So no human interaction .
So, cells have this cycle.
The cells looked better .
The small stuff counts .
What will they do tomorrow?
And they started settling out.
And they actually do .
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.
See any common themes? Principles?
But how to reach it?
So, how to build this.
Find these resources. Apply them.
Notice these other, smaller protuberances.
And these allegations are false.
And these fossils still breathe.
And these await our discovery.
No, these legs are great.
But these things are everywhere.
Fundamentally, these technologies exist today.
And these frightened her .
And these beautiful umbrellas .
It only spoils the darkness.
It only has five contributors.
Audience member 4 : Q.
The right to live, period.
I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.
I said "play," all right.
Chapter two starts in 1991.
What could I do ?
They targeted to universities .
The new me is beauty.
Our antibiotics are running out.
The second time, it's engineering.
The second "A" is Awareness.
The second challenge was cells.
The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.
The second is, we're human.
The second ingredient is autonomy.
Her cancer continued to grow.
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.
Does it have a toxicity?
And it represents your influence.
Give it up for that.
And it still didn't work?
And it certainly was .
Getting it over there ?
Do it over lunch .
So it needs refurbishment .
Warm up your voice .
We live in one world.
We live in ignorance .
Look here at Kenya .
The numbers are pretty crazy.
What should it be for?
What should they do ?
You can make multiple subjects.
What can damage accumulate in?
What can they do ?
Look what we &apos;ve ...
Look what we &apos;ve ...
I wish you sound health.
Now I am making films.
Everybody: I am my connectome.
I looked into her face.
Boy: I would love to.
Hi. I am an architect.
And I am illustrating Still.
I want you to live."
I want that to happen.
And I am among them.
I really love cheese sandwiches."
I want my million dollars.
I really don't care anymore.
Because I am HIV positive.
I knew it was big.
I really enjoyed doing this.
I want one of those."
But I would say no.
I looked like a refrigerator.
And I believe soon .
And I am thankful .
I really appreciated that .
I really was moved .
I really believe that .
And I am convinced .
But I am angry .
I knew they would .
I really loved philosophy .
I want an iPhone .
I want an iPhone .
I want an iPhone .
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.
The older face is miserable.
The food is incredible .
So those are the consequences.
And those bits are words.
Because those are voluntary distractions.
So those three actors .
So those are great .
And those distributions grow .
We see all this complexity.
We see above-ground mines .
How would we know it?
Who would go for bananas?
People would name the robots.
It would skip a beat.
How would you do it?
How would we finance this?
How would you feel ?
Who would do that ?
circuit boards of the future.
And so we started thinking.
Or so we should hope.
And so we should .
My time &apos;s up .
clinical inquisitiveness was democratized .
Here, but -- -- anyway.
We started in 2004 .
We set up a foundation.
Now, follow my actions exactly.
That's been medicalized as well.
It's been created; nobody knows.
They've been around for decades.
She's been suffering for years.
Point well made. Thank you.
One cannot assume this .
We applied the genetic algorithm.
And here is that characteristic.
You need a pressure suit.
You need a safe space.
You need a melt probe.
You need a guide .
We take a microscope slide.
his abdomen was nontender .
I pulled them aside .
They first dropped some dummies.
And first it's quite simple.
Well, first one, analytic skills.
Look very closely at pilgrimage.
It might give them pause.
It might change my behavior.
We might learn something unexpected.
Poor people are a resource.
Think about what happened .
What about Martin Luther King?
What about copying, reusing, right?
What about time and gas?
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
What about global politics ?
What about animal testing ?
What about real people ?
What about bigger numbers ?
What about energy conservation ?
What about introducing technology ?
So some people say no.
In some it is hot.
He used shell companies .
Why did she say that?
Why did I say that?
When did that last happen?
Why did she say that?
Why did America get serious?
Why did I do it?
Why did you do that?
So did my typeface .
How long are you staying?"
A page was created .
Also, high stress inhibits oxytocin.
It will always be remembered.
We will observe this day.
We will go all in.
The will is there .
And will it happen ?
Okay, one more. Baby elephant.
That's one thing to remember.
This one I particularly like.
But one thing is clear.
But one day, something happened.
That's one billion media hits.
But one really struck me.
But one more added feature.
No one works on that.
No one wants it .
This one I love .
No one &apos;s fooled .
No one believed them .
No one &apos;s laughing .
Which one seems longer ?
And they all fit together.
So they all cluster together.
There, they enter high officialdom.
No, they turn across here.
Had they consumed colored drinks?
So, they answered my emails.
And they both laughed .
So they all trained .
Do they make sense ?
Then they grow exponentially .
And they never will .
How they maintain them ?
Are they so different ?
Are they cattle ? &quot;
Are they saving enough ?
What do we do now?
What do you guys think?
What do you get then?
What do you think, honey?"
What do you see here?
What do they tell us?
What do you mean, epidemic?
What do we typically finance?
What do they look like?
What do you look for?
What do we find now?
What do they do ?
What do you see ?
What do you want ?
What do you do ?
What do you think ?
What do you do ?
What do you do ?
What do they do ?
What do they do ?
What do you say ?
What do you do ?
What do you do ?
What do you got ?
And women do fundraising .
Day five and day six.
That's our job as cosmologists.
That's our next big challenge.
That's our number. 10 billion.
Well, now is that time.
And their actions are fantastic.
We needed more time .
We live on a planet.
You influenced the market .
Compassion also looks like this.
It's also good with credit.
It's also tastes and smells.
It's also memory of sequences.
They're also harmless plankton-feeding animals.
He also appealed to hope.
Contestants also put themselves forward.
It's also about creating government.
You're also talking about baseball.
They also live deep .
They also got faster .
She also embraced violence .
You may remember these guys.
Together, may we journey well.
You may think that's impossible.
You may recognize her .

You could even hear it.
You could inform school policy.
You could inform legislation .
How could they see this?
Who could sleep that night?
How could it be otherwise?
It could get awkward, right?
How could it become iconic?
How could we survive that?
Who could blame them ?
How could that be ?
How could this be ?
How could that work ?
And so it goes on.
And so it goes .
One exception is in Massachusetts.
Now here are the facts.
And here are the statistics.
And here are the results.
So here are 12 dinosaurs.
A Mexican composer: Arturo Marquez.
What does it look like?
What does it look like?
What does it mean ?
What does it do ?
What does it mean ?
What does it mean ?
Anybody see an object there?
And I was so stimulated.
And I was so thrilled.
And I was very lucky.
Now I was pretty psyched.
BP: I was born old.
And I was like, "Sure."
And I was like, "Okay."
And I was permanently hooked.
And I was like, "Why?"
And I was just moved.
Because I was a writer.
And I was thrilled .
But I was lucky .
So I was amazed .
So I was scared .
And I was mad .
And I was fascinated .
And I was devastated .
So I was filming .
But I was intrigued .
And I was outraged .
And I was honored .
I go by the data."
I learned this from Spider-Man.
I learned something about courage.
I noticed it's very multicultural.
I go to Chrysokeras .
I go to JPL .
I learned about compassion .
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
We need — thank you.
We need culture out there."
We need new deep-diving submarines.
We need active system .
We need three things .
We need caring economics .
We need better surveillance .
We need independent corroboration .
We need someone for .
We need better tools .
We need lots more .
We need better accounting .
We need real people .
And there we are, 2001.
So there he is there.
Could there be a connection?
And there she goes, right.
Everyone there understood the project.
So there they are .
So there you are .
And there &apos;s dehydration .
And there &apos;s hypothermia .
So there you are .
And there RISD appeared .
So there it is .
And there we were .
And there he was .
And there he is .
And there &apos;s Evan .
And there you are .
And there it goes .
It should imagine a user.
How should you start ?
Business should give more .
That's probably not very many.
You can feel your body.
They can actually have both.
Amateurs can do it also.
You can do bigger things.
Secrets can take many forms.
Secrets can take many forms.
So, can we see that?
You can give drug administration.
You can do heckler mode.
Surfaces can become porous .
Deception can cost billions .
You can understand it .
You can do this .
Models can come from industry.
It can hover and rotate.
It can follow chemical gradients.
It can break sometimes .
How can metronomes communicate ?
It can prompt action .
How can you tell ?
How can this be ?
The last thing is gregariousness.
The last "A" is Authenticity.
The last thing is emotion.
The last element is partnership.
But both started exploring it.
You both feel you've won.
They both hide out .
Pune has 5,000 building sites.
Monkey has like you have.
Why has it accelerated lately?
Everyone has done something .
Why has that happened ?
Nobody has questioned it .
He has 280,000 followers .
This has huge implications .
Why has violence decreased ?
Where has it been ?
Nobody has pagers anymore .
Small people wandering about .
Constructed each plank of gold.
The others were brothers, sisters.
It began the space race.
All done in the lab.
And then it was abandoned.
And then it became news.
And then it becomes more.
And then it got stranger.
What might they find ?
We now wield the paintbrush."
Number four -- deconstruct appliances.
The same applies to educators.
The same thing happens .
Huge effect here of Starbucks.
It seemed to be infinite.
What will that lead to?
We set out on crutches.
Because, well we know why.
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.
Ninety-nine percent of you .
OK, any six of them.
Take any African economy .
But most importantly, it's voluntary.
So most everyone watches TV.
And most importantly, it's working.
And most kids do .
We even double checked .
They control your phone .
Very good for the physicians.
Days before he died .
People seem to love it.
Brains only detect nerve impulses.
If only Darwin lived today.
If only Darwin had NASA.
Another 30 percent will respond.
One example is sanitation .
But I could not understand.
I happen to have triplets.
I succeeded in my place.
I felt pretty good, considering.
I told them they're nuts.
I felt just something's broken.
I felt so sick .
Meat consumption increased five-fold .
The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.
The third area is reproduction.
The third side is us.
These people have different needs.
These people are deceived, forced.
These people are art collectors.
These people are tall .
More about that later, OK.
How about counting every calorie?
How about augmenting the physician?
How about Zander's Crevice? No.
How about artistic beauty ?
How about Facebook itself ?
How about seven hours ?
How about bed nets ?
Intent changes the picture completely.
That changes the picture considerably.
So new life was born.
Not so in Italy .
At some point something clicked.
The person buys property .
N On Twitter also .
Adults find it comforting .
Just type over it .
That's where the difference is.
You become the authority .
So it wasn't about symmetry.
And it sent me back.
But it wasn't just individuals.
Well it doesn't break even.
And it hurts your throat.
But it takes some persistence.
But it actually hits home.
But it looks completely right.
But it built a romance.
First, it represented his identity.
But it wouldn't stop there.
But it brings me back.
But it clearly cools down.
And it works. It works.
But it slightly bores me.
And it isn't always fair.
Shut it down at once."
But it doesn't stop there.
So it doesn't matter whatsoever.
Make it faster and smaller.
But it actually doesn't leak.
And it didn't stop there.
Put it on four plates.
And it made me suspicious.
Otherwise, it can't be done.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
But it paid the bills.
Hopefully it matches his taste.
But it didn't stop there.
And it -- they burned.
But it starts a conversation.
And it won't be done.
So it really is great.
Furthermore it says, "Start time."
So it can't be true."
And it can't be done.
And it actually means sad.
And it actually worked great.
Gets it right, reward him.
And it works like this.
But it wasn't that simple.
Then it came way down.
And it goes over here?
Ultimately, it gives you this.
But it works pretty well.
And it goes like this.
Did it answer the question?
So it started over here.
And it looks really good.
And it builds up exponentially.
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
But it isn &apos;t .
And it &apos;s simple .
And it looks delicious .
Then it changes again .
Give it another try .
And it &apos;s working .
But it diminishes considerably .
Did it strike you ?
But it doesn &apos;t .
Then it &apos;s gone .
Now it &apos;s gone .
Will it happen again ?
And it &apos;s interesting .
And it &apos;s everywhere .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
But it &apos;s ugly .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
Because it sounds big .
So it spawns itself .
So it &apos;s cool .
Actually it gets weirder .
Essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
But it &apos;s not .
But it goes further .
Now it encourages it .
And it &apos;s political .
Take it away Eric .
Appreciate it very much .
But it &apos;s damaging .
Well it &apos;s extraordinary .
And it &apos;s expanding .
Then it deserves protection .
Now it &apos;s green .
And it gets quiet .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Because it &apos;s true .
Will it do it ?
But it &apos;s deteriorating .
Will it be taken ?
Clearly it &apos;s freezing .
And it &apos;s fantastic .
Enjoying it so far ?
And it happened twice .
Bring it back up .
Again it &apos;s playing .
But it got attention .
Obviously it &apos;s increasing .
So it &apos;s 2006 .
Maybe it &apos;s spiders .
But it gets better .
But it &apos;s uninspiring .
How do we change behavior?
How do you test this?
How do we control them?
How do you do that?
How do we solve it?
How do you parameterize "mostly"?
How do we reconfigure it?
How do you skim stones?
How do we know this?
How do you do it?
How do you do this?
How do they do it?
How do we go faster?
How do you monetize that?
How do you get insight?
How do we explain this?
How do you cast mud?
How do we study that?
How do you get informed?
How do we know that?
How do you answer them?
How do you condense that?
How do you show that?
How do you do it?
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
How do we do that?
How do we get out?
How do you know that?
How do we do that?
How do you do that?
How do you know ?
How do you know ?
How do you know ?
How do you know ?
How do we create ?
How do you start ?
Who do you trust ?
Who do we got ?
We do more than that.
We do social change .
We do it again .
The brain works by association.
The pain gets less .
We start the meeting .
He maintained a calm insouciance.
Our standard see-through patient .
We then put in framing.
Is then sustainable development utopia?
Both countries are in Asia.
Here's how the song goes.
Here's how the dots connected.
Or if geologists were elephants?
The bone is cracked .
The exception was Japan .
We're based down in Florida.
Last question , Julian .
We believe it is .
The usual sort of thing.
Zhuomani instead of Armani .
Mental note on that one.
They make it sacred .
All preparation is preparation .
What does this all mean?
What does this compassion entail?
What does this cause us?
What does this mean ?
What does this mean ?
What does this mean ?
What does this mean ?
How does it do it?
How does it work ?
How does it work ?
People see each other behaving.
It's now a theme park.
So, now a false count.
Why would you do that?
"Why would I do that?
So would I do nothing?
Abed would say, "I'm sorry."
Why would you choose rats?
Where would that leave us?
Why would you drop out?
They would dress the robots.
Why would we think this?
They would say wolves .
Why would someone bother ?
He would appreciate it .
Why would that matter ?
Where would it go ?
Why would that be ?
Where would they train ?
They made it aspirational .
How true for Lincoln .
Now what is Atheism 2.0?
So, what is going on?
So what is rogue economics?
And what is that, structurally?
So what is open hardware?
So what is it, three-dimensionally?
So, what is it for?
So, what is it then?
Okay, what is this object?
So what is a story?
But what is electrical resistance?
So, what is your name?
And what is happiness ?
And what is concurrency ?
Shows what is happening .
So what is altruism ?
So what is happening ?
So what is next ?
Jim started in the battlefield.
A mania for learning English.
So how much is there?
That's how much it takes.
And how many employees ?
The reason is Kurdistan .
So here is normal speed.
Now here is the catch.
And here is the story.
So here is the thing.
Well, here is the image.
So here is the puzzle.
This here is Brain .
And here is RiSE .
How important is this ?
Should I do that again?
And I think you matter.
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.
And I think that's true.
I handed out Halloween candy.
Well, I think that's it.
No, I think that's wrong.
Well, I think that's interesting.
YR: I do a roll.
So I do these valentines.
Now I do own stocks.
So, I think that's good.
And I think they're breathing.
But I think that's unlikely.
And I think back .
&quot; I do . &quot;
I appreciate your time .
I disagree with that .
So I do it .
I liked being smart .
I let that pass .
I pay my taxes .
They showed up for themselves.
They showed bloody gums .
So when you put four.
That's when I got scared.
Easy when you know how.
We often think linearly .
We know that that works.
We know that isolation kills.
It will dry up inside.
Something will happen behind it.
They will do it themselves.
Which will happen around 2020.
People will forget their wisdom.
It will make you immortal.
This will take two years.
It will drive innovation .
Who will risk peace ?
It will grow exponentially .
And they don't disturb you?
When they crashed, we crashed.
And they invented, what? Gavage.
Which they decided not to.
And they wouldn't tell me.
And they go up easily.
And they brought their knowledge.
And they really, really do.
And they changed the atmosphere.
But they didn't believe me.
So they brought him in.
And they said, calcium carbonate.
And they didn't know that.
Remember, they don't study English.
Then they promote the winners.
And they go "Meow! Ow!"
And they got very upset.

And there's this huge hubbub.
Archie lets it die down.
And it's 10 triliion dollars.
It's wireless. It's always connected.
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.
So here's what you do.
So what's going on here?
There is. Head-tail-head overlaps itself.

And secondly, it's palpably false.
Now, that's a logical error.

So immediately, we're rejecting them.
TM: 12, something like that.
This time, he comes down.
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility."
And that's a simple question.
It's like, what is simplicity?
Anything else is more complicated.
You know, no power required.
Ze Frank: So -- yeah.
That song -- Thank you.
Ze Frank: My web playroom
Those magnets are in there.
Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement.
Higgs particles, if you will.

So it's time for change.
"Come on, man! What policemen?
This gin, this salty earth."

Eat it, and feel privileged.
But, again, heavy fishing pressures.

They don't. They store fat.
RW: That's terrific. Thank you.
Keith Bellows: The camel's hump
Bugs Bunny is my muse.

Well yeah, I tried that.
But we're not there yet.
First, there's no Rosetta Stone.
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.

I'm incredibly excited about that.
And "you can trust us."
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.
Okay. So, thank you, Mark.
So let's talk about effectiveness.
How? And at what scale?
Now, that's the good news.
So I'm sitting there thinking.
AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.
DP: Let Derek play it.
That is, share your lunch.
Or fire. Or dry soils.
And it's a copyright violation.
"Dig wells for five years?

She says this to me.

My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
And that's the sad part.
Again, deliberate action is needed.
Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.
But there's an interesting paradigm.
But that's not the case.
That clause was obviously ignored.
Maybe there's a biological answer.
Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income.
That's complex, but it's manageable.
Sendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.
Stefan Sagmeister: Designing with slogans
Forward, don't move the wrist.

Another suit. LG: Diamonds, perfect.
Oh sorry, I dropped one.
Looks good, like Batman. Ow!
Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts.
Maybe I'll stand up. Half.
Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.
No? Yes! Ah, good, good.
And queen! Queen, with misdirection.
He sounds something like this.
But that's not happening here.
So that's pretty much it.
They say, "Really? How many?"
Well, charity became their answer.
Okay? Ready? Let's do it.
So that's a good thing.
So Kleiber is about process.
But we're spending 36 percent.
Well what's going to give?
No crows are brought up.

And it's a charming read.

You know, it's just ludicrous.
"For sale: White trash compactor."
He hung up on me!
And didn't that feel good?
Yikes! So many big threats!
Fiber: next-generation way of communicating.
So again, radical versus conservative.
Don't move. Stand your ground.
They laughed. They dismissed us.
Nirmalya Kumar: India's invisible innovation
Ten percent's come from India.
And they're investing in energy.
Now, that's completely changed now.

Now it's all available online.
And he's five years old.
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
There ain't no first time.
She can't understand the dialogue.
We've got all of that.
And it's true. It's true.
Come on: those masterpieces ...
OK? Stop. All right, now.
So, ah, that was fun.
Hopefully everybody? More than 10?
No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.
It's classically learning by doing.
So there's more. There's more.
Well, it's the relative importance.
And there's some spectacular things.
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.
So they're simple building blocks.
Phil Hansen: Embrace the shake
It's incredibly difficult to parse.
So that's the bottom line.
But we're not so comfortable.
But it's time to talk.
Sherry Turkle: Connected, but alone?
MO: So we started organizing.
Together: Someone get me Post-its!
And there's two of me.

She got a support network.
Another "Associate Director of Research."
This amazing person, Muriel Cooper.
So here's what we're doing.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
We've got to change that.
Naturally 7: A full-band beatbox
You've misunderstood totally," he said.
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.
And Cyrus makes a declaration.
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.
Ultimately, that's what it's about."
He said, "It's absolutely possible."
Terrible Najmuddin, is that one.
Their decisions, their actions matter.
Thank you, and God bless.
And I'll tell you why.
Hmm. You've heard of it.
Why don't they affect me?
And everything began pretty auspiciously.
Everything else is the same.
So it's a straightforward machine.
Now, let's imagine a parallel.
Now, don't get me wrong.
And again, everyone ate local.
I've talked for three minutes.
So that's a large number.
JH: Whoa. That is ...
TS: So something like this.
JH: So many forces there.
But it's actually a painting.
So that's what she did.
But it's become something else.
Origami revolves around crease patterns.
And yeah, you really can.
HR: So there you go.
SR: "Did that just work?"
Thank you. XL: Thank you.
Pico Iyer: Where is home?
Now, we're still collecting data.
So, salamanders can do it.
Anthony Atala: Growing new organs
And you'd make these chairs.
Shit, you've missed 25 years.
My kids love this stuff.
That's it. Please save this.
So here's exhibit number one.
This guy is no Republican.
Lawrence Lessig: Re-examining the remix
And they're just so uncomfortable.
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!
Onyx Ashanti: This is beatjazz

Or, "How can we help?"
And then, the systemic risks.
My father's a little different.
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat] SW: Yeah.
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
SW: Do your head now.
E: Happy birthday to you.
E: Happy birthday to you.
E: Happy birthday to you.
E: Happy birthday to you.
Jonathan Eisen: Meet your microbes
So how's all this governed?
That's neo-Nazi math for you.
Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.
And it's a made-up word.
They didn't know how to.
Some rocks and some finches.
Joshua Silver: Adjustable liquid-filled eyeglasses
Oh, you're wiggling your toes.
You glaze over with it.
Which means, "Take my camera."
And they're also curiously aggressive.
Thank you. Thanks very much.
Hi, sir, how are you?
Now, let's try that again.
No, they're not the same.
They say, "Let's question authority."
And again, think about it.
So glamour can be dangerous.
Eve Ensler: Suddenly, my body
This pirate is called Joshua.
Fantastic. Just stay up here.
Capital, Malé, where I live.
Then Malé, then further south.
They're up, and they're off.
They hatched out in India.
And that's where it breeds.
It's, well, you can imagine.
And they're not all bad.
RM: You'll get a text.
Thank you. John. That's great.
So that's another demographic fact.
JH: Last question. Right here.
So now, how is that?
Benevolence, loving kindness against hatred.
And jumping monks of Tibet.
And yet, look around us.
But that's not completely true.
And occasionally, there are disasters.
This song is called "Fingertips."
So that's what I do.
My bitches wear my collars.
Walsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.
Bess: As you wish, Majesty.
And it's like a magnet.
Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Thumper: Some fun, huh, Bambi?
Ha ha. No, no, no.
This locomotion was completely involuntary.
And it's full of challenges.
It's "Aria" of John Cage.
Right. So what has changed?
And Wikipedia has embraced this.
They'll fund anything these days.
But again, it's very paternalistic.
Washington, D.C. went out here.
But ignore the top part.
So they're moving further apart.
TM: Thank you very much.
TM: Thank you very much.
So, it's a normal-looking syringe.
And they're focusing on function.
And it's in every cell.
Janine Benyus: Biomimicry in action
So see, here's the thing.
So funny things can happen.
So he's just explaining something.
Now here's an interesting comparison.
And yes, we Africans can.
Remember, that's a short time.
Kary Mullis: Play! Experiment! Discover!
Miru Kim: My underground art
So here's some inorganic life.
Of course, they're not alive.
Now, that's a bit boring.
And forgive the complicated diagram.
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.
They're inanimate, they're not alive.
Until midnight, he'd be thinking.
"No ... not at all."
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars.
LP: Thank you very much.
Their burn-up is much higher.
So, it's a fake real.
Joseph Pine: What consumers want
And that's the whole piece.
So, that's a finished gear.
And I'm not that far.
You've heard about solar flares.
She said, "What's going on?"
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.
Gary Wolf: The quantified self
You know, a data network.
This lets you do it.
You don't have enough time.
So bees have social healthcare.
So remember, I said 4D.
No, they're all out there.
They're glorified drill and practice.
Radio 2: That was gorgeous.
You couldn't satisfy this guy.
So, let's see some memes.
Susan Blackmore: Memes and "temes"
So that's what I did.
And here's how it went.
Anyways, I... where to start?
We've got another 10 minutes.
Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.
DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.
So here's what Dan said.
But we're not there yet.
And it's monitoring their reliability.
But that's not electricity yet.
It's fast, it's pretty private.
Many prototypes crashed -- many.
RD: Yeah, yeah. It did.
And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!"
"So biology, genetics?" she said.
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.
So it's got hybrid drive.
So that's it speeded up.
And it's a power park.
Children: One, two, three, go.
So finally, texture is something.
So we're building these buildings.
And that's my final slide.
And here's just one example.
He didn't follow his passion.
We're plugged in; we're connected.
I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.
Now Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.
Robin Ince: Science versus wonder?
Meet Tony. He's my student.
Damon Horowitz: Philosophy in prison
Fundamentally it's a consumption issue.
JP Rangaswami: Information is food
So I'm sorry about that.
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.
True story, by the way.
So that's what Lauren did.
AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.
She goes, "What about dogs?"
They don't want to change.
So it's probably an overestimate.
And that's what happening now.
But there's lots of stuff.
Hold still, you're the scale.
They don't own those facilities.
They don't employ those workers.
Our democracies rely on elections.
And that's the tough part.
But there's no major difference.
Hans Rosling: Religions and babies
And that's what we did.
And let's add satellite confirmation.
From there, we dove in.
And he's on a mission.
You're clear. All right. Firing.
Who's got the hero view?
Your Google Science Fair champions.
So, here's the first story.
And here's an interesting map.
My husband's like, "Honey, deception?
Here's Koko with her kitten.
It's starts really, really early.
That bothers me the most.
No, she's not, she's beautiful.
And that's my little workshop.
No loo, no "I do."
ES: Thank you very much.
This one's several stories tall.
Here's crabs here, worms here.
It's absurd. It's just absurd.
And here's how it works.
He prays before he eats.
Come on, raise your hands.
And we're not burning anything.
Jane Fonda: Life's third act
Most bees don't perceive red.
Brenda Brathwaite: Gaming for understanding
And it's a beautiful idea.
Our heroes are human heroes.
And it's odd, isn't it?
You're immersed in the liquid.
Help me! Somebody help me!"
And so, what after that?
No, that's the last swim.
But that's just the beginning.
And it's a wonderful thing.
But hey, they grow back.
Ready? So here it comes.
Liberation, however, costs some money.
Now, what's going on here?
Boaz Almog: The levitating superconductor
And it's not just computation.
Voice 2: It's coming again?
So it's not all hopeless.
So we've done pretty well.
We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.
He said, "I think so."
And here's inside the brain.
But we've got a problem.
And you're like, "Holy shit!
And it's pretty amazing actually.
Anyway, I'm out of time.
Hillel Cooperman: Legos for grownups
We've got a climate crisis.
Every dot is a person.
Nicholas Christakis: B, it's obvious.
We've got a conveyor there.
That's happening statistically right now.
He moved with the headlines.
He negotiates with the Serbs.
Samantha Power: A complicated hero
Josette Sheeran: Ending hunger now
This isn't a genetic disease.
So, it's a fundamental problem.
That I'm this uber-endurance guy?
And I'll expand this up.
You heard about neuromodulators earlier.
But it's not only education.
Yet, it's 160 years old.
And radio waves are limited.
And security is another issue.
You think, "Ha, ha, ha.
But there's an ecosystem here.
"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom!
You know, calculus is wonderful.
Ian Dunbar: Dog-friendly dog training
OK. Now, you're 19 now?
And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.
But really, it's pretty robust.
OK, that's one case report.
Joe DeRisi: Solving medical mysteries
What's mine communicating to you?
No, it's worse than that.
But it's everybody's idea now.
And we're doing it again.
Now hang on a minute.
If you'll pardon the expression.
Well done, ladies and gentlemen.
Nicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy.
